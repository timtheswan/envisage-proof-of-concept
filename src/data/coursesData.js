With respect to identity, personal narratives will be explored to find one’s fullest expression and deepest sense of true place when we yield to God’s calling (vocation) to embed who we are and what we do within the larger Biblical narrative. Responsibility will be examined in light of desire to live Biblically coherent lives. Properly deciphering personal responsibilities requires the hard work of using the Bible authentically and connecting knowing with doing. The role of narrative as a framework for analysis when unpacking critical questions will be used. Alternative worldview narratives are also considered in light of the biblical narrative. In particular, the modern Western culture's claim that we must personalize all normative concerns will be examined. Responsibilities are viewed as being shaped by the institutional settings (through roles and responsibilities) that normatively structure the places where we learn, work, play, and worship. The centrality of Hope and God’s Kingdom is explored as motivations to be intentional actors of hopes is compared with obstructions or distractions from living Biblically coherent lives. Attention is given to view of hope as being justified and efforts not made in vain (in the reality of the Kingdom and Holy Spirit) amidst a fallen world marked by brokenness, disappointment, and suffering.

Support of their domestic policy recommendations must include international sources. The final project requires each group to present an executive summary of their findings and recommendations in a mock Congressional briefing held in a Congressional office building.
