Undergraduate Catalog
2019-2020
There are those who seek knowledge for the sake of knowledge;
that is curiosity.
There are those who seek knowledge to be known by others;
that is vanity.
There are those who seek knowledge in order to serve;
that is love.

Our Heritage, Mission, and Life Together
2019 marks the 173
rd anniversary of the founding of Taylor University. During the year of 1846, the United States annexed New Mexico as a territory,
admitted Iowa as the 29th state in the Union, and declared war on Mexico. Electric arc lighting was introduced in Paris; Elias Howe patented the sewing
machine in the United States; John Deere constructed the first plow with a steel moldboard; and American dentist W. T. Morton introduced ether as an
anesthetic. In the literary world, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow published “The Belfry of Bruges” and Herman Melville published “Typee.” In London, and
the Evangelical Alliance was founded, and Charles Dickens introduced the English newspaper, the Daily News. In Ireland the failure of the potato crop caused
a famine, which would send thousands of Irish immigrants to America. Also in 1846, the Smithsonian Institute was established in Washington D.C., and
certain political and religious movements in the United States gained momentum in advocating the emancipation of slaves and promoting expanded rights
for women.
Forged in the fire of intense religious beliefs, Taylor University was destined to become one of the oldest evangelical Christian colleges in America.
Conceptualized with the conviction that women as well as men should have an opportunity for higher education, Taylor University began as Fort Wayne
Female College in Fort Wayne, Indiana, and then became Fort Wayne College. Following the example of Oberlin College (which became the first
coeducational college in America and the first to award college degrees to women in 1841), Fort Wayne College became coeducational in 1855. In 1890,
the school merged with the Fort Wayne College of Medicine and changed its name to Taylor University in honor of Bishop William Taylor, an energetic
missionary evangelist possessed with unusual vitality of commitment and devotion. Bishop William Taylor became a symbol of the values and ideals of the
college. His voluminous writings including many books on preaching and missions and extensive worldwide missionary endeavors resulted in his being the
first lay pastor to be named a bishop of the Methodist Church.
In 1893 because of the population boom in the central part of the state, Taylor University moved to Upland, Indiana. Nearly 100 years later in 1992, Taylor
University reestablished its presence in Fort Wayne by acquiring Summit Christian College. (Summit had started in 1895 with the sponsorship of the
Missionary Church Association and the spiritual leadership of Joseph P. Ramseyer and Daniel Y. Schultz.) In 2009, undergraduate programs at Taylor
University Fort Wayne (TUFW) were discontinued and consolidated on the main campus in Upland.
With this heritage, Taylor University entered the twenty-first century. Taylor University’s historian Dr. William Ringenberg noted, “The intellectual
revolution at the turn of the century cracked the spiritual foundations of major universities” in America by challenging the role of the Christian worldview.
“This, coupled with the dehumanizing of education” and the unrest caused by “the inability of secular education to guide students in their quest for meaning”
helped to further shape, strengthen, and define Taylor’s Christian educational mission. For over 170 years, Taylor has been faithful to that mission.
Taylor University trustees, administrators, faculty, staff, and students stand committed to our heritage of Christian commitment and academic excellence.
Implementation of Mission — A Christian Liberal Arts College
Taylor University is an evangelical, independent, interdenominational Christian liberal arts university in which all programs are shaped by a biblical, Christian
worldview and the integration of faith, learning and living within a community of intentional Christian nurture and relationships.
Taylor is distinctive in its commitment to both spiritual and intellectual development as symbolized by the twin spires of the Rice Bell Tower. Academic
pursuits at Taylor are rigorous, demanding imagination, dedication and integrity from both students and faculty. As a Christian institution, Taylor University
has highly capable, supportive faculty who recognize that all truth has its source in God. Students’ quests for truth begin with this conviction and relate to
all aspects of the liberal arts curriculum.
Taylor University carries out its mission and purposes primarily by offering undergraduate programs in its residential campus setting. Within this
environment, curricular and co-curricular programs advance the holistic development of students expressed through servant leadership, global and civic
engagement, service, and life-long learning. These programs engage students through collaborative faculty-student research, experiential and service learning,
internships, and international study.
The University offers focused graduate programs that expand and complement curricular and institutional strengths. Taylor University Online offers select
undergraduate and graduate courses, including summer school opportunities, and programs for students who are not in residence.
The University employs dedicated faculty, professional, and support services personnel who align with its mission and enable outstanding programs within a
culture of continuous quality improvement.
Taylor’s campus reflects a vision of physical facilities that combines aesthetics, functionality, and timely maintenance.
The University’s location in the pastoral, small town environment of Upland, Indiana, seventy miles north of Indianapolis and fifty miles south of Fort Wayne,
complements a commitment to foster interpersonal relationships that edify, enrich, and value all members of the University community. The proximity to
metropolitan areas provides numerous benefits, including access to specialized healthcare and cultural and entertainment opportunities including music,
theater, art, professional athletics and commerce. There are also several nature preserves, state parks, and outdoor recreational areas reachable within two
hours or less.

Mission, Purposes, and Anchor Points
The mission of Taylor University is to develop servant leaders marked with a passion to minister Christ’s redemptive love and truth to a world in need.
In order to advance this mission, Taylor University is committed to the following purposes:
 To provide whole-person education, involving students in
learning experiences imbued with a vital Christian
interpretation of truth and life which foster their
intellectual, emotional, physical, vocational, social, and
spiritual development.
 To offer liberal arts, professional, and lifelong education
based upon the conviction that all truth has its source in
God, and that being biblically anchored, the Christian faith
should permeate all learning leading to a consistent life of
worship, servant leadership, stewardship, and world
outreach.
 To create specific experiences wherein the integrative focus of a
Christian liberal arts education is clarified, personalized, and applied.
 To contribute to the advancement of human knowledge and
understanding and serve the evangelical Christian church and the
larger (public) community for the glory of God.
 To foster a biblical model of relationships that acknowledges both
unity and diversity of the followers of Christ within a covenant
community and which can be evidenced in a continuing lifestyle of
service to and concern for others.
 To maintain and foster appropriate and effective support services
that enable maximum program effectiveness throughout the
University.
Anchor Points
 Biblically Anchored
 Christ Centered
 Faith Learning Integrated
 Liberal Arts Grounded
 World Engaging
 Whole Person Focused
 Servant Leader Motivated
Statement of Faith
To more explicitly define the meaning of Christian higher education as used in the Articles of Incorporation, and the methods and policies by which the
proposed results are to be achieved through the University or any affiliated educational institution under the control of the University, the following
statements of belief and practice are set forth:
Taylor University is firmly committed to the lordship of Jesus Christ and evangelical Christianity. To assure the central place of Christian principles in the
philosophy and life of the University, the trustees, administration, faculty, and staff believe that:
 There is one God, eternally existent in three persons—Father,
Son, and Holy Spirit—the only Creator, Redeemer, and Sustainer of
all things in heaven and on earth.
 The Bible is the only inspired, authoritative written word of God,
true and trustworthy in all it affirms.
 Jesus Christ is the eternal, living Word of God. Through his
incarnation he revealed God’s plan of redemption by his virgin
birth, sinless life, atoning death, bodily resurrection, and
ascension. He will return in power and glory to judge the living
and the dead.
 The Holy Spirit is present in the life of every believer, testifying to
the lordship of Christ, illuminating the Scriptures, and
empowering believers for fruitful service and obedience to God's
commands.
 Humankind, though uniquely created in God’s image, rebelled and
stands in need of redemption. God, by his grace, extends
salvation, reconciliation, and eternal life to anyone who comes to
Christ by faith.
 The Church is the global body of believers across time who affirm
that Jesus Christ is Lord and demonstrate their faith and unity in
Christ by loving and serving him and all people.

The Life Together Covenant
Responsibilities and Expectations for Community Life at Taylor University
Introduction
Taylor University is a community of Christians intentionally joined together for academic progress, personal development and spiritual growth. The mission
of Taylor University is to develop servant leaders marked with a passion to minister Christ’s redemptive love and truth to a world in need.1
 Together we
seek to honor Him by integrating biblical faith and learning while our hearts and lives embrace the process of maturing in Christ.
The Taylor community consists of those who, in furtherance of our mission, are living together in intentional, voluntary fellowship, aware that we are called
to live our lives before a watching world. Although primarily centered on the Upland campus, this community is not defined by geography, but rather by
active engagement in the Taylor educational mission.
The Life Together Covenant (LTC) identifies the expectations for living in community as we seek to fulfill our mission. It is impossible to create a community
with expectations totally acceptable to every member. Nevertheless, certain responsibilities and expectations must be specified to assure orderly community
life. When individuals join the Taylor community, they freely and willingly choose to take upon themselves the responsibilities and expectations outlined in
this covenant. The University Expectations are not intended to measure spirituality or to promote legalism. Nevertheless, Galatians 5:13-14 reminds us that
while we were called to be free, our freedom is best used when we serve one another in love. (Romans 14:1-23; 1 Corinthians 8:1-13, 10:23-33)
A foundational support for the Life Together Covenant is the Taylor University Statement of Faith. The Statement of Faith affirms that the Bible is the
inspired and authoritative word of God, and it provides the essential teachings and principles for personal and community conduct. The Statement of Faith
also affirms the presence of the Holy Spirit in every believer; God, through the Holy Spirit, places in every believer the inner resources and attributes to
minister to others through supportive relationships.
1Taylor University Mission Statement
Biblical Responsibilities
Responsibilities for Loving God, Others, and Self
We glorify God by loving and obeying Him. Because we are commanded to love one another, relationships and behaviors which reflect such love confirm
our allegiance to God and are glorifying to Him. (Matthew 22:36-40; John 15:11-14; Romans 15:5-6)
Living in daily fellowship with other Christians is a privilege and an expression of God's will and grace. In recognition of this privilege, great value is placed
on the quality of relationships in our community. We acknowledge that we are living in a fellowship where we are dependent on and accountable to one
another. The New Testament word for fellowship is koinonia, which is translated as a close mutual relationship, participation, sharing, partnership,
contribution, or gift. Members, therefore, are encouraged to seek opportunities to demonstrate koinonia. (1 Corinthians 12:12-31; Ephesians 4:1-6)
All persons are created in the image of God, and each person is known by God and knit together in the womb with intentional design. God's attention to
creative detail is uniquely applied in each person in whom is given the capacity to love God with heart, soul, mind and strength. The commandment to love
our neighbor as ourselves reminds us of our potential to minister to others while at the same time recognizing our own need for care and support. (Psalm
139:13-14; Mark 12:29-31; 1 Corinthians 6:19)
Responsibilities for Community
Within our community the greatest expression of fellowship and the highest principle for relationships is love. Since God first loved us, we ought to
demonstrate love toward one another. (1 John 3:11, 16, 18; 4:7-21) For the purpose of our community we have identified the following specific expressions
of love as being among the most desirable.
• Building Up One Another: We expect each member of the community to strive consciously to maintain relationships that support,
encourage and build up one another. (Romans 15:1-2)
• Making Allowance for One Another: Because of our fallenness, difficulties in relationships do occur. In such cases we are to respond
with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience, making allowance for each other and forgiving one another. (Colossians 3:12-13)
• Caring for One Another: We are responsible to come alongside those experiencing grief, discouragement, illness, tragedy, or other
personal trials. Expressions of bearing one another's burdens include comfort, encouragement, consolation and intercession. (Galatians 6:2)
• Respecting One Another: Because of the God-given worth and dignity of persons, each member of the community is expected to be
sensitive to the image of God created in every person. Therefore, discrimination against others on the basis of race, national origin, age, gender
or disability is not acceptable. Any kind of demeaning gesture, symbol, communication, threat or act of violence directed toward another person
will not be tolerated. (Colossians 3:11-14; 1 John 3:14-18)
• Speaking the Truth in Love: A community such as ours can be strengthened by speaking the truth to each other with love. Problems in
relationships and behavior can be resolved constructively by confronting one another in an appropriate spirit. If the welfare of the one being
confronted is paramount and if the confronter is motivated by and acting in love, the process can produce growth. (Ephesians 4:15)
• Reconciliation, Restoration and Restitution: Healing broken relationships is necessary for a healthy community. When relationships
have been harmed, regardless of the reason, individuals are expected to reach out to one another, forgive one another, restore relationships and
make restitution. (Matthew 5:23-24; 18:15-17)
9
Responsibilities for Individual Attitudes and Behavior
 Attributes of the Heart:
Scripture gives us mandates for daily living through the Ten Commandments and the Sermon on the Mount. (Exodus 20:2-17; Matthew 5-7) In
addition, Scripture teaches that certain attributes are available to individuals through the Holy Spirit. These attributes include: "love, joy, peace,
patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. Against such things there is no law." (Galatians 5:22-24 NIV) This "fruit of
the Spirit" is to be sought, encouraged and demonstrated in our relationships. We are also called to live lives characterized by peace and holiness.
(Hebrews 12:14) In contrast to encouraging these positive attributes of the heart, Scripture condemns injustice and attitudes such as greed,
jealousy, pride, lust, prejudice and hatred. Although these attitudes are sometimes difficult to discern, they can hinder relationships with God and
others and lead to unacceptable behavior. (Galatians 5:19-21; Ephesians 4:31; Micah 6:8)
 Prohibited Behaviors
Certain behaviors are expressly prohibited in Scripture and therefore are to be avoided by all members of the community. They include theft,
lying, dishonesty, gossip, slander, backbiting, profanity, vulgarity, crude language, sexual immorality (including adultery, homosexual behavior,
premarital sex and involvement with pornography in any form), drunkenness, immodesty of dress and occult practice. (Mark 7:20-23; Romans
13:12-14; 1 Corinthians 6:9-11)
 Academic Integrity and Truthfulness
As a Christ-centered University community we apply biblical responsibilities for honesty to all forms of academic integrity. Plagiarism is forbidden;
we expect truthfulness and fidelity to be expressed in every learning context. (Luke 16:10; Ephesians 4:25)
 Submission to Civil Authority
In keeping with scriptural admonitions to bring ourselves under the authority of government, members of the Taylor community are expected
to uphold the laws of the local community, the state and the nation. An exception would be those rare occasions in which obedience to civil
authorities would require behavior that conflicts with the teaching of Scripture. On such occasions, each individual would submit voluntarily to
the penalty for his or her behavior. (Romans 13:1-7) Behavior resulting in arrest on or off campus is subject to review within the University's
disciplinary procedures.
University Expectations
In addition to subscribing to the section on Biblical Responsibilities, members of the Taylor University community voluntarily commit themselves to the
following expectations of behavior. This commitment results from the conviction that these expectations serve the common good of the individual and the
institution. These expectations are not set forth as an index of Christian spirituality, but rather as values and standards of the Taylor community and guidelines
that serve to preserve the ethos of the campus communities. Furthermore, they reflect our commitment to helping each member of the community grow
in maturity and in the ability to make wise choices. Because of the importance of trust and responsibility to one another, violations of these expectations
are regarded as a serious breach of integrity within the community. The following expectations apply to all members of the campus communities: the faculty,
staff, and students of Taylor University.
 Worship
Corporate worship, prayer, fellowship and instruction are essential for our community. Therefore, students, faculty and administrators are
expected to attend chapel. Faithful participation is understood as a mature response to our community goals. We expect that individual honor
and commitment to the Taylor community will motivate us to attend chapel. In addition, members of the community are encouraged to participate
in the life of a local church.
 Lord’s Day
Members of the community are to observe this day as a day set apart primarily for worship, fellowship, ministry and rest. While activities such as
recreation, exercise and study may be a part of the day, "business as usual" relative to University programs and services will not be sanctioned or
encouraged.
 Entertainment and Recreation
The University expects its members to use discretion and discernment in their choices of entertainment and recreation (some examples include
media, Internet usage, and games). Each year, Student Development may sponsor a limited number of on-campus dances for the campus
community. The University also considers the following forms of dance as acceptable for the campus community: sanctioned folk dances, dances
that are designed to worship God, dancing at weddings, and the use of appropriate choreography in drama, musical productions and athletic
events. In order to preserve and enhance our intentional community, other social dancing is not permitted on or away from campus. Activities
and entertainment that are of questionable value or diminish a person's moral sensitivity should be avoided. Consideration for others and
standards of good taste are important, and all activities should be guided by this principle.
 Illegal and Legal Substances
Taylor University prohibits the possession, use or distribution of illegal substances and the abuse or illegal use of legal substances, including
prescription and over-the-counter medication.
 Tobacco
Recognizing that the use of tobacco is injurious to one's physical health, members of the campus communities will not possess, use, or distribute
tobacco in any form on or off campus. In addition, our campuses are smoke free.
 Alcoholic Beverages
The community recognizes the potential risk to one's physical and psychological well-being in the use of alcoholic beverages. It also recognizes
that use of alcoholic beverages can significantly and negatively impact the community. Accordingly, faculty, staff and students will refrain from the
use of alcoholic beverages. Alcoholic beverages are not served at any University functions or programs on or off campus.
 Gambling
Gambling (the exchange of money or goods by betting or wagering) is viewed as an unwise use of God-given resources and is not acceptable in
any form.
10
 Respect for the Property of Others
Members of the community are expected to respect the property of others, including University property, private property on and off campus,
and public property. The intellectual property of others is also to be respected.
 Policies and Procedures
Compliance with day-to-day policies and procedures of the community is expected from members. These routine items are listed in the Student
Life Handbook, the Master Policy Manual, and the University catalog.
Application
The University affirms that the Biblical Responsibilities and University Expectations outlined herein lead to responsible citizenship and positive and healthy
lifestyle, and they support the fulfillment of the University mission. While members of the community are encouraged to follow the principles of this LTC
throughout the year, it is specifically applicable for students while they are actively engaged in the educational mission (Fall Semester, Interterm, Spring
Semester, and Summer Term, including Thanksgiving and spring breaks) or are representing Taylor in any off-campus events. For employees, it is specifically
applicable during the periods of their service or employment contracts.
Conclusion
The book of Colossians provides an appropriate summary of the goals for our community:
"Therefore, as God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved, clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear
with each other and forgive one another if any of you has a grievance against someone. Forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues
put on love, which binds them all together in perfect unity. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, since as members of one body you were
called to peace. And be thankful. Let the message of Christ dwell among you richly as you teach and admonish one another. . . . And whatever
you do, whether in word or deed, do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through him." (Colossians 3:12-17 TNIV)

Multicultural Philosophy Statement
We believe in equality of all people as imbedded in biblical teachings and as an integral part of Christian commitment. We acknowledge that this is affirmed
in the Constitution of the United States of America. We believe in an environment in which people can live and work cooperatively, valuing the multiple
cultures from which they have come without violating institutional values. We believe in multicultural education as an interdisciplinary effort to prepare
graduates who understand, appreciate, and work effectively with those who are different from themselves. We believe in global interdependence, implying
the need to graduate individuals capable of functioning as global citizens.
Sanctity of Life Statement
Scripture affirms the sacredness of human life, which is created in the image of God. Genesis 1:27 NIV states: So God created man in His own image, in the
image of God He created him; male and female He created them. Therefore, human life must be respected and protected from its inception to its completion.

Campus Location and Facilities
Campus Highlights
Taylor University is nestled in the rural gentleness of Upland, Indiana, population 3,845 (2010 census). Taylor’s quiet location adds to its charm, yet Upland’s
central location, just four miles from Interstate 69 between Indiana’s two largest cities (Indianapolis and Fort Wayne), gives students quick access to the
cultural diversity of larger communities.
Taylor’s borders are as wholesome as the setting itself including residential areas, the Upland Health and Diagnostic Center, and the Avis Corporation, along
with many natural settings such as Taylor Lake spanning eight acres, the Avis-Taylor Prairie Restoration Project, and the 65 acre beautifully preserved
Arboretum. The University also owns 668 acres northwest of campus which have added an additional 80 acres of arboretum space.
The campus is spacious and scenic with many points of interest. In addition to the Library and its collections, the Zondervan Library building, residing next
to the Bell Tower, houses the Engstrom Galleria, the Ringenberg Archives and Special Collections, and several academic support services.
Upon leaving the north entrance of the library, the Rice Bell Tower is visible immediately north, symbolizing our commitment to spiritual integrity and
academic quality. A brief stroll north from the bell tower will reveal the Samuel Morris statues. Designed by Ken Ryden and erected in October 1995,
these statues symbolize the process of enlightenment Morris experienced as he journeyed from being a tribal prince to a slave, to a student in America with
a burden to share the message of God’s grace. Through Ryden’s work, Samuel Morris continues to inspire the Taylor community. The statues adjoin the
Modelle Metcalf Visual Arts and Rupp Communication Arts Centers (housing the 320-seat Mitchell theater—Taylor’s theatrical history includes classics as well
as original productions written by Taylor alumni and students), and the Smith-Hermanson Music building.
In the center of campus is the Rediger Chapel/Auditorium, home for our great chapel program. The LaRita Boren Campus Center surrounds the Rediger
Chapel/Auditorium. This new facility is the home for our student development program as well as a community space for our students, staff, parents, and
alumni to gather; it also houses the Campus Store Express and food and beverage establishments including the Jumping Bean, Fresh, Dashi, Emma and
Charlie’s, and Chick-fil-A.
To the north are more residence halls including Samuel Morris Hall, Swallow Robin Hall, the more recently added Wolgemuth Hall (35,970 square feet
of apartment-style units for 92 students), and Campbell Hall (19,167 square feet of apartment space for 60 student beds). The Freimuth Administration
building is the home of several administrative functions for students and staff alike. The historic quad houses Helena Hall (home of our President, Provost,
and Admissions functions), Sickler Hall, and Ayres Memorial Hall. Also in the north part of campus is “the dome,” which will house the Boren Western
American art collection.
On the east side of campus is the Nussbaum Center, our original home for the sciences. Perched atop the Nussbaum Science Center is the observatory
featuring two new reflecting telescopes: a 10-inch Celestron and an 8-inch Meade. Both have motor mounts for all-night star tracking. The Euler Science
Complex includes 127,000 square feet and connects to the north side of the Nussbaum Center. The science program space includes a green roof, geothermal
heating and cooling, photovoltaic solar, and a heliostat. The lower level is home to the Education Department as well. The Reade Liberal Arts building
houses many of our foundational core programs.
The south side of campus is known for housing and serving our students via Breuninger Hall, Wengatz Hall, Olson Hall, English Hall, Gerig Hall, and Bergwall
Hall—all student resident spaces. Attached to Bergwall Hall is the Hodson Dining Commons, which has recently undergone transformation in food serving
centers.
To the west lies our combination of artificial and natural turf athletic fields (baseball, football, track and field, softball, lacrosse, and soccer). Odle Arena is
our competition floor and attached is our wonderful Kesler Student Activities Center (KSAC). An addition to KSAC, the Eichling Aquatics Wing, houses
the indoor lap pool and the academic Kinesiology program.
Prayer is an important feature of our campus life and facilities. In the heart of campus, just southwest of the library, is the Memorial Prayer Chapel that honors
the lives of students and staff from Taylor University. On the southwest corner of campus, students seeking solitude may wish to visit the prayer deck. Secluded
among the greenery of Taylor Lake and overlooking the water, the prayer deck is a popular spot for meditation and Bible study. The original prayer chapel,
presented by the graduates of 1950 and class sponsor (and future president) Milo A. Rediger, is located on the northeast side of campus in Sickler Hall and offers
a spiritual respite.
Academic Facilities
The Ayres Alumni Memorial Building is a 19,000-square-foot facility housing the Center for Research and Innovation (CR&I), and the Bedi Center for
Teaching and Learning Excellence (CTLE). It was named for Burt W. Ayres who served Taylor as professor and administrator for nearly 50 years. Several
academic offices and the Masters in Higher Education Offices are located in the Kenyon Educational Center on the lower level, along with the University’s
telecommunications network and staff; the CTLE and SCGE share the main level which includes a faculty seminar room, and the offices for the directors and
staff. One large state-of-the-art classroom and two smaller classrooms are also located on the main floor. Psychology faculty offices and a reception area
are located on the third floor.
Located in the KSAC, the Eichling Aquatics Wing houses the indoor lap pool and the kinesiology program.
The Euler Science Complex was completed in 2012. This facility includes 127,000-square-foot of science program space in a four-story building, including
an undesignated lower level, a green roof, a 9,175-square-foot atrium, and space for science offices, classrooms, and labs for biochemistry and chemistry,
biology, computer sciences, elementary and secondary education, engineering, mathematics, physics, and public health. The building is LEED gold certified
and utilizes a photovoltaic solar array for green power, as well as a heliostat for natural lighting.
Modelle Metcalf Visual Arts Center, a 38,000-square-foot center, provides specialized art studio and classroom space, a computer graphic arts lab and
audio-visual classrooms, and a secure gallery adjacent to the Mitchell Theatre. The Tyndale Galleria provides space for students to display creative work. This
building features dedicated spaces specifically designed and outfitted for instruction in painting, sculpture, ceramics, printmaking, metals, photography,
drawing, and graphics. In addition, an outdoor sculpture garden is planned to enhance the campus on the north side of the building. Along with the
Zondervan Library, the entire fine arts complex occupies the center of campus, signifying Taylor University’s commitment to the fine arts as a central
component of a Christian liberal arts college.

The Zondervan Library sits in the center of campus, representing its centrality to the mission of the University and the success of academic pursuits. The
Library provides information resources, services, and connections for students, faculty, and staff while striving to support curricular needs, to nurture
intellectual curiosity, and to promote spiritual development.
Through the Library’s website users can discover resources both within the library and beyond. In addition to books, periodicals, and DVDs within the
Library’s walls, it provides a vast range of electronic resources, including full-text databases and eBooks. Virtually all of these electronic resources are
available both on- and off-campus to students, faculty, and staff with a valid Taylor network username and password. Zondervan Library provides even more
resources through Interlibrary Loan.
One of the purposes of library faculty is to teach students skills in identifying and evaluating information as these will prove useful in every career and serve
as a foundation for lifelong learning. Librarians interact with students through classroom instruction as well as individual consultations regarding information
research strategies and tools. Walk-up research assistance is available from the Ask desk, which is situated directly inside the Library’s main entrance.

Turner Stadium serves as the home to the Taylor football, men’s soccer, and women’s soccer teams. The stadium, located north of Odle Arena, is a $3.5
million complex that includes an artificial game surface, new home and visitor stands, lights, a new scoreboard, and a new stadium entrance. The stadium
was renovated in the summer of 2012 thanks to a generous contribution from an anonymous donor. In the summer of 2015, a new press box, game day
plaza, and additional stadium upgrades were added.
Odle Gymnasium is named for the late Don J. Odle, coach and professor of physical education, and his wife Bonnie. This 45,000-square-foot facility contains
two racquetball courts, an all-purpose room, a conference room overlooking the basketball court, classrooms, faculty/coaches offices, and a collegiate
basketball and volleyball maple parquet floor court with three cross courts.
The Taylor Cross Country Course is located just over a mile west of campus. This championship quality course features both a five kilometer and eight
kilometer loop which both meander through fields and wooded areas.
Jim Wheeler Practice Field is the practice field for the Taylor football, men's soccer, and women's soccer teams. The artificial surface practice facility is
located northwest of Turner Stadium and features a full-sized football/soccer field with lighting for night practices.
The Winterholter Field is located centrally and has an artificial infield surface which was renovated in 2012, and the new amenities make this facility an
exciting place to watch a baseball game. In the spring of 2015, outdoor lighting was installed and in 2017 a press box was added.
Computer and Technology Resources
Taylor University strives to keep current in the technology it provides to students and employees. Upon enrollment, every student is provided a network account,
email address, and electronic portfolio that can be developed over four years and fine-tuned prior to graduation.
Students can log into myTAYLOR to access email, campus announcements, news, weather, sports, class schedules, financial aid, billing information, grades, and
transcripts, as well as links to registered courses. The Blackboard course management system is widely used by professors to supplement class activities
and provide online resources for students.
A high priority has been placed on providing technology for teaching and learning. Every classroom is equipped with a projector and multimedia computer
technology, providing ready access to presentation software and online resources. All buildings have wireless internet access for students using laptops and
mobile devices. Zondervan Library offers the latest in online research capabilities. General-purpose computer labs are available for students from early
morning to late at night.
The Technology & Learning Connection is the support hub for academic technology and a valuable resource for students and the entire TU community.
Located on the main level of Zondervan Library in the center of campus, the Connection offers an impressive array of resources and services including media
duplication, scanning, high-quality prints and posters, lamination, digital video editing, audio editing, a professionally-equipped sound studio, and a large
selection of audio/video/computing equipment available for check out. Inside the Connection, computer technicians are available to assist with technology
and computing needs.
Taylor University is primarily a Windows campus, although specialty areas such as art, film and media production, and music also utilize Apple
computers. Taylor’s network is based on the Windows operating system, as are most University-owned computers, but students bringing Apple computers
to campus are able to take full advantage of Taylor resources. Microsoft Office is the standard application suite.

Academic Calendar
Taylor University’s academic year consists of Fall and Spring semesters, as well as optional January Interterm and Summer sessions. The typical class period
is 50 minutes per credit hour.
Under this schedule, fall semester activities including examinations are concluded prior to the Christmas recess. Classes are conducted each semester for
a period of 15 weeks including a 4-day examination period.
The optional January Interterm provides students an intensive period of study in a single course or opportunities to study in off-campus centers in the United
States and international locations.
Additionally, three Summer sessions are available to enhance and supplement students’ educational programs and meet special program requirements.
The academic calendar is available online at http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/academic-calendar.shtml. Students are responsible for complying with published
academic deadlines and regulations as stated in the University schedule of classes, academic calendar, and academic catalog.
Credit Hour
Each course at Taylor University is assigned a number of credit hours, based on the traditional Carnegie Unit, as the unit of measure of the course’s level of
instruction, academic rigor, and time requirements. A credit hour, the amount of work established by stated student learning outcomes and achievement,
is approximately one hour (or 50 minutes) of classroom or direct faculty instruction, and a minimum of two hours (for undergraduate) or three hours (for
graduate) of out-of-class work, each week for a 15-week term (or the equivalent amount of work for a term of a different length).
Classroom or direct faculty instruction and out-of-class student work leading to the award of credit hours may vary for courses that require laboratory
work, internships, practicums, studio work, online work, research, guided study, study away, and other academic work to achieve the identified student learning
outcomes. In addition, student workload may vary based upon program expectations established by national or regional accrediting bodies.
For classroom-based courses, each credit hour indicates a minimum of 15 hours (of 50 minutes each) of instruction and at least 30 hours of supplementary
assignments.
For non-classroom-based courses that require less time for out-of-class supplementary assignments (such as laboratories, studios, and performances), each
credit hour indicates a minimum of 30 hours (of 50 minutes each) of instruction.
For non-classroom-based courses in which students are engaged in independent projects that require additional out-of-class work and are guided by regular
instructor feedback (such as research and independent studies), the credit awarded for supervised individual activity will be awarded with a correspondence
of one credit per 45 hours of student activity.
For mixed face-to-face, hybrid or blended courses, in which more than 25% of the instruction is provided online, credit hours are assigned based on the
credit assigned to traditional courses of comparable rigor, content, and time requirements.
For online courses, in which the instruction is provided exclusively online, credit hours are assigned based on the credit assigned to traditional courses of
comparable rigor, content, and time requirements.
For correspondence courses, the credit hours awarded for a course must be reasonably equivalent to the standard of three hours of combined direct instruction
and student work per credit hour for a 15-week semester (45 hours for a one credit hour class, 90 hours for a 2 credit hour class, and 135 hours for a 3 credit
hour class). At Taylor, the minimum course completion time is 12 weeks, and the maximum is four months from the date of enrollment.
For internship courses, each credit hour indicates a minimum of 40 clock hours of work.
For courses where the primary learning activity is experiential (such as clinical work, field work, or student teaching), credit hours are assigned in compliance
with the standards of the relevant professional accrediting organization and with common practice in higher education.
Assignment of credit hours for courses occurs during program/course approval processes and is monitored through faculty, curriculum, and program reviews
established by the University.
Instructional Time for Terms
Each credit hour represents 700 instructional minutes during a term. The following chart represents instructional minutes with no breaks included. A
minimum of 50 additional minutes should be allotted for a final exam; a separate exam time is already scheduled for the full semester.

Academic Policies and Regulations
Academic policies and regulations are developed and approved by the faculty of Taylor University and are administered by the Schools and the Registrar.
Intended to be rigorous and challenging, these policies and regulations are administered with individualized attention and concern for the educational
advantage and well-being of each student.
Academic Advisors
The purpose of Academic Advising at Taylor University is to assist students in developing educational and career goals that are compatible with their
perceived life calling; empower students to accept responsibility and leadership in developing their own educational plans; and aid students in their
professional, emotional, and spiritual development.
Students are assigned an advisor from their academic department(s). Students that have not declared a major are assigned an advisor in the Academic
Advising Office. The Academic Advising Office advisors also serve as a secondary advisor to students that have declared a major. The Office of the Registrar
with the assistance of the academic departments and the Academic Advising Office will oversee advisor assignments. All students are required to meet with
their advisor prior to registering for courses each semester. Students are expected to be prepared for advising sessions and to be aware of published
deadlines and regulations as stated in the University schedule of classes, academic calendar, and catalog.
While Taylor University publishes program information and materials and provides advisors, each student is solely responsible for ensuring that his or her academic
program complies with the policies of the University. Any advice that is at variance with established policy must be confirmed by the Office of the Registrar.
Academic Exceptions
Students requesting exceptions to approved academic policy must submit an academic petition to the Office of the Registrar. The student must state his or her
request and rationale for the petition and obtain the signatures of the instructor and department chairs, if applicable, and the academic advisor before submission
to the Registrar’s Office. The Registrar and School Dean will review the petition before action is taken by the Academic Policies Committee, if necessary.
Academic petition forms are available through the Office of the Registrar.
Academic Grievance
Preamble
Taylor University is committed to preserving a climate of openness and justice in all areas of academic life. To that end, procedures have been established
to provide fair treatment of both any student who registers an academic complaint and any faculty member who has been accused of unfairness toward a
student. These procedural guidelines are not contractually binding on the University.
Definition of an Academic Grievance
Whenever a student has a basis for believing that he or she has been unfairly treated in such matters as grades, course policies or expectations, false
accusations of cheating, or inappropriate penalties, he or she may be said to have an academic grievance.
Procedure
The following steps, based upon the biblical standard of caring confrontation which should be the first step in any dispute, have been identified as necessary
for consistency in the grievance process. Any student who feels that unfair treatment may be taking place in his or her academic experiences should follow
the established process in sequential steps until there is satisfactory resolution of the program or until the procedures have been exhausted.
Informal Process
The informal process should be completed within one month of the alleged unfair treatment. Prior to the first appointment with the faculty member
involved, the student should have the unfair treatment clearly focused in his or her mind by writing out a concise statement of the problem and the desired
resolution. Faculty and administrators who are contacted may ask to see the written statement. By appointment, the student should discuss the issue with
the faculty member involved. The student and faculty member may each invite another person to be present. If necessary, the student should discuss, by
appointment, the issue with the faculty member’s department chair, or the School dean if the faculty member is the department chair.
Formal Grievance Process
If a formal grievance is deemed necessary, the steps outlined below should be followed:
1. Within one month of the alleged unfair treatment, the student should submit a written statement of the grievance and the desired resolution to the
appropriate School dean who will attempt to resolve the grievance through conferences with the parties involved.
2. If the grievance has not been resolved within ten working days from the School dean’s receipt of the written grievance statement, the parties involved
should meet in consultation with the appropriate School dean.
3. If, after consultation with the parties involved, the student is still dissatisfied with the outcome, the appropriate School dean should assemble, within 20
working days from receipt of the written grievance statement, a grievance committee acceptable to both parties for reviewing the complaint and submitting
a recommendation. If the parties cannot agree on an acceptable grievance committee, the appropriate School dean retains full discretion to select the
members of the committee. The grievance committee should consist of five voting members including:
An administrator (may be a department chair or School dean, but not the head of the involved department or School) appointed to serve as chair
by the appropriate School dean;
Two students; and
Two faculty members.
4. Parties directly affected by the grievance should provide the grievance committee with available data in writing, including summaries of previous conferences
and actions, to bring about understanding and a timely recommendation regarding the grievance.
5. The committee should then proceed as follows:
Formalize its procedure to hear the grievance;
Conduct hearings during which the grievant and the faculty member are given opportunity to present their points of view;
Deliberate;
Reach a recommendation by a simple majority vote of the committee; and
Make a recommendation to the appropriate School dean to either affirm the action which is the subject of the academic grievance, to take no
action one way or the other, or to take appropriate corrective action.
19
6. The committee’s recommendation should be made in writing to the appropriate School dean within 15 working days of the committee’s appointment.
7. The appropriate School dean should make a decision regarding the committee’s recommendation, and should notify the parties in the grievance of the
outcome and any resultant action within 48 hours of receiving the committee’s recommendation.
Note: Grievance actions required during calendar periods which are not working days (such as vacation), should be handled as quickly as possible and in the spirit of the
“working days” listed above.
Appeal Procedure
Either party has an opportunity to appeal the grievance decision to the present of the University within one week of the notification by the appropriate
School dean (see item 7 above). Within another week, the president should review the case and render a decision to be transmitted to both parties.
Hearing Procedure
Grievant: The grievant should be allowed to:
Select counsel any member of the university community willing to serve in this capacity;
State his or her grievance, including submitting evidence of its existence;
Call as witnesses current members of the university community who consent to speak; and
Question anyone who participates in the grievance process.
Faculty Member: The faculty member should be allowed to:
Select counsel any member of the university community willing to serve in this capacity;
Respond to the grievance in every particular including submitting evidence to support the action or decision provoking the grievance;
Call as witnesses current members of the university community who consent to speak; and
Question anyone who participates in the grievance process.
Exceptions
If a grievant perceives a conflict of interest in any of the steps, he or she may proceed to the next step. If this process cannot be followed due to the
unavailability of the faculty member, the appropriate School dean may ask the immediate supervisor of the faculty member to assume responsibility for
answering the grievance.

Academic Integrity
As a Christ-centered intentional community, everything we do and say reflects our identity in Christ and our position as a part of this community; thus,
integrity in all areas of life is critical to our own spiritual life and is equally critical to the life of the Taylor community.
Academic dishonesty constitutes a serious violation of academic integrity and scholarship standards at Taylor that can result in substantial penalties, at the
sole discretion of the University, including, but not limited to, denial of credit in a course as well as dismissal from the University. Any act that involves
misrepresentation regarding the student’s academic work or that abridges the rights of other students to fair academic competition is forbidden. Academic
dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating on assignments or exams, plagiarizing, submitting the same (or substantially the same) paper in more than
one course without prior consent of all instructors concerned, depriving others of necessary academic sources, sabotaging another student’s work, and
using without attribution a computer algorithm or program. In short, a student violates academic integrity when he or she claims credit for any work not
his or her own (words, ideas, answers, data, program codes, music, etc.) or when a student misrepresents any academic performance. All major acts of
academic dishonesty, as defined herein, must be reported by the faculty member to their School dean and the Office of Student Development. Departments
or professors may have discipline- or course-specific policies.
Plagiarism
Definition: In an instructional setting, plagiarism occurs when a person presents or turns in work that includes someone else’s ideas, language, or other (not commonknowledge¹) material without giving appropriate credit to the source.²
Taylor distinguishes between major and minor plagiarism infractions. Examples of minor infractions include inappropriate or inadequate citing or not crediting
ideas from class readings. Examples of major infractions include taking significant portions of text from any source with no attribution or having a peer help
write the paper. Taylor also distinguishes between collaboration, writer’s feedback, and plagiarism. Collaboration and getting feedback on one’s own writing
are essential parts of the writing process; however, having a text altered for the writer is not. The level of appropriate collaboration on individual writing
assignments is up to each professor; and each professor should make it clear to his or her students what level of collaboration is appropriate for each writing
assignment (e.g., brainstorming with other classmates for ideas). Writer’s feedback means having a peer or a Writing Center tutor work with the student
to provide suggestions for revision in ways that allow the student author to maintain ownership; this is not plagiarism. However, having a peer make changes
to the organization, ideas, paragraphs, or sentences for the student demonstrates a level of ownership over the work; thus, these acts would be considered
plagiarism.
Plagiarism Policy: All major acts of plagiarism must be reported by the faculty member to the appropriate academic School dean and Student Development.
The student and faculty member involved will receive a copy of the completed plagiarism incident report. All incident reports will be archived in both the
academic School and Student Development and will be viewed and used solely by the deans of these offices to track plagiarism incidents in order to catch
patterns of behavior. This tracking will affect student consequences for any additional plagiarism incidents reported and may affect recommendations for
off-campus student activity participation. Plagiarism records in the academic School office and Student Development will be destroyed along with all other
student records according to their respective policies.
¹ Common knowledge means any knowledge or facts that could be found in multiple places or as defined by a discipline, department, or faculty member.

Academic Load
Fall/Spring Semesters
Registration for 12+ credit hours during the fall or spring semesters constitutes full-time enrollment status. A normal academic course load is 14-16 hours
per term. Students with a minimum grade point average (GPA) of 2.00 may carry 17 credit hours.
An academic load greater than 17 hours requires a minimum GPA and authorization from the Office of the Registrar. A minimum GPA of 3.00 is necessary
to carry 18 hours; 3.30 GPA for 19 hours; and 3.60 GPA for 20 hours (the maximum load permitted). An additional tuition charge will be assessed per credit
hour above 17 hours per term.
Interterm
Registration for 3-4 hours is considered a normal load for January interterm; the maximum load is 5 hours and requires a minimum GPA of 3.00 and
authorization from the Office of the Registrar. An additional tuition charge is assessed for the fifth hour.
Summer Term
A normal academic load during the May-June summer term (18 days) is 3-4 credit hours; the maximum load is 5 hours and requires a minimum GPA of
3.00 and authorization from the Office of the Registrar.
A normal course load during the June-July summer term (24 days) is 3-6 credit hours. Carrying 7 credit hours requires a minimum GPA of 3.00
and authorization from the Office of the Registrar; the maximum load is 8 hours which requires a minimum GPA of 3.60 and authorization from
the Office of the Registrar.
The maximum course load for all summer terms combined is 12 credit hours which includes all transfer credit, Taylor University Online (TU Online), and
correspondence courses, as well as Taylor University courses. Registration for 12 credit hours of Taylor courses constitutes full-time enrollment status
for summer.
Experiential education (e.g., practicum; internship; field and travel studies) and directed research courses are only offered during the 12-week full summer
term.
Candidates for summer graduation should participate in May Commencement provided they have submitted an approved plan with no more than 8
credit hours remaining to be completed by the official summer graduation dates.
Academic Progress Policy
A student who meets the minimal GPA requirements as indicated in the chart below is considered to be a student in good academic standing. A student who
falls below the minimum required GPA is placed on academic probation and enters a special advisement program under the direction of the Academic Enrichment
Center and the academic advisor. For students not in good academic standing, notification will be sent by the Registrar to students and their advisors through
campus email and letters will be mailed to students’ permanent addresses within one week following submission of final grades by faculty.
Cumulative Earned Hours Minimum Required GPA
00.00-12.99 1.60
13.00-30.99 1.70
31.00-44.99 1.80
45.00-60.99 1.90
61.00 + 2.00
The faculty, staff, and administration of Taylor University are committed to helping students be successful in their personal, spiritual and intellectual lives.
As such, the GPA of each student is reviewed twice annually at the end of the fall and spring semesters to determine whether action needs to be taken with
respect to probationary status.
Students placed on probation have one semester in which to meet good academic standing as indicated in the chart above. Reevaluation does not take place
after January or summer terms. Failure to reach the minimum requirements in the following semester results in suspension from the University, unless
during that semester the student achieves a term GPA of 2.30. Students who earn a 2.30 term GPA may be placed on extended probation and allowed to
remain at the institution for the subsequent semester. Students on extended probation are not eligible to receive financial aid and are required to enter a
special advisement program under the direction of the Academic Enrichment Center and the academic advisor.
First-time suspension is for one academic semester; a second-time suspension is for one academic year (consecutive fall and spring semesters). Students
may apply for readmission following the applicable suspension period. Readmission is not automatic and requires the approval of several offices on campus,
starting with the Office of Admissions. Students must present evidence that they are academically prepared to return to Taylor. Additionally, readmitted
students will be placed on extended probation requiring reentrance to the special advisement program under the director of the Academic Enrichment
Center and the academic advisor and are not eligible for financial aid during the return semester.
Academic probation and suspension carry additional related consequences:
 Eligibility for financial aid is affected by academic standing. Probationary and suspended students should check with the Office of Financial Aid
regarding academic progress regulations pertaining to their financial aid.
 No student on academic probation may apply for any off-campus study programs.
 No student on academic probation may enroll in distance learning or independent study courses unless repeating a course.
 No academically suspended student may enroll in any Taylor courses, including those offered by Taylor University Online (TU Online).
 In some cases, it may be advisable for a suspended student to enroll in courses at another institution in order to demonstrate that he or she is
prepared to achieve better academic work prior to readmission to Taylor. Students should consult with the Registrar in advance of such
enrollment.
Contact the Office of the Registrar for additional information regarding academic progress.
21
Advanced Placement and Credit by Examination
Students may qualify for advanced placement and college credit by satisfying the standards set by individual departments to pass the College Board Advanced
Placement Examinations (AP), the College Level Examination Program (CLEP), the International Baccalaureate (IB) credit at the higher level, and Cambridge
General Certificate of Education Advanced Level Examinations (GCE A-Level).
Students may be eligible for placement at the next level of the college sequence and may receive college credit if the overall quality of their performance
merits such recognition. A maximum of 30 hours of advanced placement and credit by examination may be applied to meet graduation requirements. Score
levels vary between subjects; score levels considered passing may be obtained by visiting https://www.taylor.edu/how-to-apply/testing-and-placement.
For additional information regarding advanced placement and credit by examination, contact the Offices of the Registrar and Academic Assessment.
Advanced Placement Examinations (AP) and College Level Examination Program (CLEP)
Prior to entering Taylor, students interested in AP or CLEP testing credit should contact the Office of Academic Assessment to request information regarding
testing policies, fees, deadlines, and limitations.
AP credit must be elected and the transcript posting fee paid in the student’s first semester at Taylor. CLEP exams should be taken, credit elected, and
transcript posting fee paid for prior to reaching senior status at Taylor.
Refer to the Proficiencies section of this catalog for specific policies, procedures, and deadlines related to AP/CLEP credit for ENG 110 College Composition. Refer to
Language Requirements for Bachelor of Arts Degree in the Degree Requirements section of this catalog for information regarding CLEP credit for intermediate language.
International Baccalaureate (IB)
International Baccalaureate is a rigorous pre-university course of study that leads to examinations. For a student to obtain IB credit, the courses must be at
the higher level (HL), scores must be 5 or higher, and the transcript posting fee must be paid; courses for the major are subject to departmental review.
Official transcripts must be requested from the IB office, not the high school; syllabi may be required if the course subject has not been reviewed recently.
Cambridge General Certificate of Education Advanced Level Examinations (GCE A-Level)
GCE A-Level credit may be awarded with a grade of D or higher. Students must submit a certified copy of the examination certificate and examination
syllabus to the Office of the Registrar. Credit will not be awarded on the basis of a results slip. Academic departments must approve credit for exams and
the transcript posting fee must be paid.
Class Attendance
Students are expected to attend all sessions of classes for which they are registered. Unexcused absences (without permission to make up work) must not
exceed the equivalent of one absence per credit hour of the course. The number of class period absences will depend on the nature of the class meeting
schedule. For a three hour three day per week class, this would be three class period absences. For a three hour two day a week class, this would be two
class period absences. For a four hour four day per week class, this would be four class period absences. The penalty for excessive absences (defined
below) is communicated in each course syllabus. Students are responsible for obtaining and understanding the attendance policies for each of their courses.
When courses are added after the first course meeting, any class sessions that have already been missed may be counted as unexcused absences.
The Unexcused Absences are designated for such reasons as travel difficulties, bad weather, conflicting schedules, oversleeping, job or graduate school
interviews (beyond the allotted number), minor untreated sickness, or routine non-emergency doctor or dental appointments. Please note that most
illnesses such as sore throats, ear infections, colds, or stomach problems are minor and do not require the attention of a medical professional. These
absences are unexcused absences. If a medical professional believes an illness to be sufficiently severe that an absence from class is warranted, then the
absence would require documentation from the professional to be excusable.
Absences related to social events such as weddings or family vacations are also unexcused absences. Although the date of such events may be outside of
the control of the student, these are not considered to be excusable. Travel arrangements made around holidays for cost purposes are also not considered
to be excusable. Excused absences are reserved solely for family emergency or health reasons, specified student job or graduate school interviews, or
University-sanctioned group events.
For all Excused Absences, the student is responsible for providing required documentation to the representative of the Provost’s Office. Individual
excused absences (with permission to make up work) will only be granted for the following circumstances:
Illness: Excused absences for illness will only be granted for the following circumstances: 1) admittance to a hospital; 2) a serious illness verified
by treatment by a medical professional. Such an illness would be one that the medical professional determines would necessitate absence from
class. Appropriate documentation verifying treatment should be provided to the student and submitted along with a request for Excused Absence.
Such documentation must verify dates that the student needs to miss class. Students suffering from a serious emotional illness (as documented
and verified by the Office of the Vice President of Student Development) may also request excused absences. Appropriate verification should be
provided to the representative of the Provost’s Office along with a request for Excused Absence.
Family Emergencies: Family emergencies may also be excused upon verification. This would include death or hospitalization of an immediate
family member. An immediate family member would be considered to be a mother, father, sister, brother, spouse, child, or grandparent. As
noted above, weddings or family vacations are social in nature and not considered to be family emergencies.
Job or Graduate School Interviews: These would include employment, internship/practicum, or graduate school interviews. Students are
allowed 1 such absence in their junior year and 2 such absences in their senior year.
Taylor University-Sponsored Job Fairs: Students who participate in Taylor sponsored job fairs may request excused absences for those
events. Appropriate documentation should be provided to the representative of the Provost’s Office.
Group Absences: It is also possible for students to be excused from a class due to participation in University-sanctioned group activities (class
field trips, official athletic events, and other sanctioned activities). The faculty member/sponsor of each group is responsible for providing
appropriate documentation and a request for such absences to the representative of the Provost’s Office. Student athletes and participants in
musical ensembles, because of their potentially more frequent class absences, may not be allowed the usual one excused absence per credit hour
in each course. Students involved in these activities should check with their coach and professor for specific policies.
22
Students are responsible for course material missed due to any excused absence and may be required to get in-class work and homework to a professor
prior to the excused absence. Students who know they will be missing a class for any reason (athletic events, music performances, interviews, field trips, or
appointments) should check with their professors to find out what work should be turned in prior to the excused absence and what work can be made up
after the absence, making arrangements for all assigned work/activities. The student should evaluate current class standing when anticipating absences. Loss
of instruction and the consequent possibility of a lower class grade are the results of an absence. In any type of class requiring active participation
(laboratories, presentations, seminars, etc.), grade reductions are inevitable.
Excessive Absences: Satisfactory academic performance in any class is compromised when a student accumulates an excessive number of absences for
any reason. There comes a point in the semester when the ability of a student to complete a course satisfactorily is lost due to class absence. If students
reach the point where they have missed 30% of the scheduled meetings for a class, their case will be referred by the instructor to the Academic
Enrichment Center for evaluation. If it is deemed that the student is incapable of completing the class, a withdrawal may be recommended. If the student’s
absences can be overcome but further treatment is deemed necessary, an incomplete may be recommended. It is incumbent on faculty members to report
students who have accumulated excessive absences to the representative of the Provost’s Office. At that point, a conference with the faculty member and
the Academic Enrichment Center will occur, and a plan of action will be recommended to best accommodate the needs of the student and the requirements
of the class.
Classification of Students
Matriculated students are those students who have fully met all requirements for admission and have enrolled in courses to meet undergraduate degree
requirements. Matriculated students are classified as follows:
Cumulative Earned
Credit Hours Class
0.00-30.99 Freshman
31.00-60.99 Sophomore
61.00-94.99 Junior
95.00 + Senior
Entering students (first-time or transfer) are classified consistent with the Integrated Postsecondary Data System. Those students identified as first-time students
are entering a postsecondary institution as an undergraduate degree-seeking student for the first time after receiving their high school diploma. This includes
students with dual credit earned before they graduated from high school, or an associate degree earned before or at the same time as high school graduation.
Entering students who complete a high school diploma at the same time as an associate degree are classified as first-time students requiring them to
participate in the First-Year Experience course. Classification is based upon the number of credit hours a student has earned which includes transfer credit.
Dean’s List
Full-time students are named to the Dean’s List when they have earned a 3.60 or better GPA for the term and when at least 12 credit hours carry quality
point values.
Distance Learning Policy
No more than 16 hours of distance learning may be taken to fulfill degree requirements; Blackboard courses offered during Fall, Spring, and Summer terms do
not count toward this restriction.
The guidelines listed below for accepting transfer credit are also used in evaluating distance learning courses taken at other accredited universities. After
enrolling at Taylor, students must complete a transfer credit course approval form signed by the student’s academic advisor, course department chair, and
the Registrar prior to enrolling in the course. The major or minor department chair’s signature may be required if the course is a major/minor requirement.
Upon completion of the course, students should request their transcripts be sent directly to the Office of the Registrar at Taylor before the next enrollment
period.
Courses taken through Taylor University Online (TUO) require the completion of the TUO course approval form which includes the approvals stated
above. Grades earned affect the student’s GPA and are recorded on the student’s transcript. Normally, these online courses are not considered part of the
academic load for tuition, enrollment verification, or financial aid purposes. Students on institutional academic probation are not permitted to register for
courses through TUO unless repeating the course. No academically suspended student may be enrolled in any Taylor courses, including those offered by
TUO. Candidates for graduation must complete all distance learning course work and exams so that final grades are submitted by the dates specified by the
Office of the Registrar.
TUO course approval forms are available online at http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/forms.shtml.
Eligibility for Intercollegiate Athletics
For participation in intercollegiate athletics, students must typically be enrolled full time, carrying at least 12 credit hours. In addition, they must meet the
eligibility regulations and academic progress rules of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA).
Experiential Education
Experiential education includes practicum experiences, internships, and field and travel studies providing students with the opportunity to integrate
theoretical learning in a major field of study with actual work experience in a variety of non-classroom settings. Students should consult with academic
departments and supervising faculty for departmental policies, guidelines, and responsibilities.
Tuition for experiential education completed during the Summer is at the standard Summer session credit hour rate. Check with the Financial Aid Office
to inquire about possible assistance for the summer term. Experiential education courses are not eligible for audit credit.
Registration forms for experiential education are available online at http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/forms.shtml. For additional information, please
refer to Specific Registration in the Registration section of this catalog.
23
Practicum
Usually completed during the summer, a practicum course is a significant applied-learning experience with a meaningful, supporting component that enables
students to observe, apply, and better understand previously studied theory.
An individual practicum can be done for 1-4 hours of credit; a maximum of eight hours of credit can be earned through practicum experiences for degree
requirements, subject to departmental requirements. Completed under the direction of a faculty advisor and an employer supervisor, students are required
to complete a minimum of 40 clock hours of work experience for each academic credit earned. Academic departments may require additional work hours
to meet curriculum requirements within the major program; students should consult with academic departments and supervising faculty for departmental
policies, guidelines, and responsibilities.
Students generally arrange their own practicum assignment with guidance from and the approval of the supervising instructor. Registration for a practicum
should take place before the term in which the practicum credit is to be given. Enrollment in a practicum requires the consent of the instructor and the
approvals of the academic advisor and course department chair.
Academic credit is given for the practicum; therefore, the cost of a practicum is the same as for a regular course and is based on the number of credit hours.
Tuition for a practicum completed during the Summer is billed at the standard Summer session credit hour rate for this experience.
Internship
An internship is an advanced-level, discipline-related, culminating field experience directed toward preparing students for professional licensure or entrylevel positions. Internship placements should be substantive, new, and educationally rewarding, rather than a continuation of a prior work experience.
Completed under the direction of a faculty advisor and an employer supervisor, students are required to complete a minimum of 40 clock hours of work
experience for each academic credit earned. Academic departments may require additional work hours to meet curriculum requirements within the major
program; students should consult with academic departments and supervising faculty for departmental policies, guidelines, and responsibilities. Students may
earn a maximum of 16 hours of credit, subject to departmental restrictions, toward graduation requirements through the internship experience.
Internships are usually completed during a regular semester and require students to devote their full time, effort, and attention to completing requirements.
Therefore, it is recommended that students not enroll in additional courses during the term when internships are being completed.
Academic credit is given for the internship; therefore, the cost of an internship is the same as for a regular course and is based on the number of credit
hours. Tuition for an internship completed during the Summer is billed at the standard Summer session credit hour rate for this experience.
Field and Travel Study
Field and travel study experiences are usually a component of a regular course and provide students opportunities to learn, observe, and assist professionals
with selected tasks in an off-campus setting related to a career or program goal. Students are placed, supervised, and evaluated by the faculty responsible
for the course. Assignments related to field experiences become part of the overall course evaluation.
Academic credit is given for field and travel studies; therefore, the cost of a field or travel study is the same as for a regular course and is based on the number
of credit hours. Tuition for a field or travel study completed during the Summer is billed at the standard Summer session credit hour rate for this experience.
Final Examinations
Students must take their final examinations at the assigned hours listed on the final exam schedule. Exceptions are made only due to serious illness or death
of an immediate member of the family. Reasons such as plane schedules, availability of flights, and rides leaving early are not acceptable exceptions.
Students scheduled to take more than two final exams on the same day may, with written permission from the instructor, reschedule an exam(s) to maintain
a maximum of two exams per day. Students must contact the Office of the Registrar to begin the rescheduling process. Rescheduling must be approved at
least 10 days prior to the last class day of the semester.
For courses with “TBA” class days, the instructor will announce the exam time. Should the announced time conflict with another scheduled exam, the
professor who announced the exam time will make the accommodation. Should two scheduled exams conflict, students must contact the Office of the
Registrar to begin the rescheduling process.
Refer to the final exam schedules posted at http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/exams for respective Fall and Spring semester dates.
Grade Changes and Disputes
Acceptance of late or missing assignments after the end of a term does not qualify for a change of grade.
All requests for change of grade (except from an INC or NR) are initiated by the student with the professor of record and then must be approved by the
School Dean. Questions regarding the grade must be directed to the instructor within two weeks after being posted to the transcript. If the student is
unable to come to an agreement with the instructor regarding the grade issued, the student must meet with the Department Chair. If a solution is not
reached with the chair, or the chair is the instructor, the student would need to schedule an appointment with the School Dean. If an agreeable outcome
is still not reached, the final step in the grievance process would be to request a committee hearing; the decision reached by the committee would be final.
A grade change is permitted only before the end of the semester following the term the original grade was awarded.
Grades, Incomplete and Not Reported
All work for credit is expected to be completed within the term it is attempted including independent studies, tutorials, and experiential education. An
incomplete grade (INC) may be given when an emergency prevents a student who has been passing the course from completing some crucial portion of the
required work, but not to complete late or missing assignments or extra work to raise a grade.
Incompletes should be initiated by the instructor of record prior to the final exam week and must be authorized by the appropriate School Dean before
they are submitted to the Office of the Registrar. Incompletes should be converted to grades and reported to the Registrar by the date approved. The last
possible date for completion is the week before final exams of the following full term. If the student does not complete the work by the approved deadline,
the Registrar is authorized to change the INC to the grade earned by the student.
The Registrar will record an NR (grade not reported) when grades are unavailable, such as receipt of transcripts for off-campus study programs or faculty
emergencies. If no grade has been provided, the Registrar is authorized to change the NR to a grade of F.
24
Grade Reports
Students may view midterm and final grades through TOWER (Taylor Online Web Enabled Records); midterm grades are entered only if below C-.
Midterm grades are not recorded on the student’s permanent record in any way. Allow approximately one week after the last final exam for calculating
and posting of final grades. Grade reports are not mailed. Visit http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/tower.shtml for additional information on
accessing TOWER.
Grades for Repeated Courses
Any cataloged course may be repeated at Taylor University. All attempts in a course are reflected on the student’s academic transcript; the cumulative
GPA will reflect the most recent grade in the repeated course taken at Taylor University, even if the new grade is lower than the original attempt.
Grades of W (withdrawn), WP (withdrawn/passing), or AUD (audit) will not replace previously earned grades of A-F, WF (withdrawn/failing), or NC (no credit) in the GPA
calculation. Duplicate credit hours are not awarded when repeating a course.
See Transfer Credit Policy in this section for information about courses taken from another college.
Grading System
The following grades and quality points are assigned to undergraduate students at Taylor University in calculating the GPA:
Grade Meaning Quality Points Calculated in GPA
A Superior 4.00 Yes
A- 3.67 Yes
B+ 3.33 Yes
B Good 3.00 Yes
B- 2.67 Yes
C+ 2.33 Yes
C Satisfactory 2.00 Yes
C- 1.67 Yes
D+ 1.33 Yes
D Minimally acceptable 1.00 Yes
D- .67 Yes
F Failing 0 Yes
P Pass (C- or above) 0 No
CR Credit 0 No
W Withdrawn 0 No
WP Withdrawn/passing 0 No
WF Withdrawn/failing 0 Yes
INC Incomplete 0 No
NR Grade not reported 0 No
NC No Credit/failing 0 Yes
AUD Audit 0 No
The unit of credit is the semester hour. Grade point average (GPA) is calculated by dividing quality points by GPA hours and is truncated at two decimal
places. Grade point hours include only Taylor University courses taken for a grade as outlined above.
Independent Study Policy
Independent studies are individualized, directed studies taken without classroom instruction or regular interaction with a faculty member. The student is required to
plan with the professor an individualized schedule of reading, research, and study. Assignments, papers, tests, and other means of assessment may be completed by
appointment, mail, email, remote proctors, Internet, etc.
Students and faculty alike are encouraged to schedule independent studies during the summer session when the calendar and personal schedules of students and faculty
are more flexible. The shortened academic calendar makes independent studies impractical for the January interterm. During the fall and spring semesters, independent
studies are considered exceptions due to faculty workload limitations, but may be approved under certain circumstances, such as:
1. To complete a graduation requirement without which the student’s graduation would be unreasonably delayed. (A student’s desire to graduate in less
than four years, to double-major, add a minor, etc., does not meet this requirement.)
2. To resolve scheduling conflicts beyond the student’s control involving required courses which cannot be taken in a later semester or summer term
without negative impacts on the student’s program of study.
3. To provide a scheduling efficiency or convenience to the University, such as offering the independent study as an alternative to a low-enrollment
class section, deviating from regular course offering schedules, etc.
4. To offer both the student and supervising faculty member the opportunity to expand their Taylor experiences with special/advanced topic courses
that may serve special needs such as specific career goals, graduate school prerequisites, etc.
No student who is on academic probation may register for an independent study unless it is to repeat a course. No student may complete more than 12 hours of
independent study. All other academic policies in this catalog apply to independent studies (e.g., criteria for requesting incomplete grades, deadlines for registration).
Typically, students will be charged a fee of $125 per credit hour in addition to the tuition charge for an independent study; this fee will not be charged during
the summer session. Tuition for independent studies completed during the Summer is at the standard Summer session credit hour rate for this experience.
Check with the Financial Aid Office to inquire about possible assistance for the summer term.
Registration forms for independent study are available online at http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/forms.shtml. For additional information, please refer
to Specific Registration in the Registration section of this catalog.
25
Transfer Credit Policy
Transfer request forms are typically available from the college in which courses have been completed. Taylor University does not accept transfer credit
older than 10 years.
New Students
To receive credit for course work earned at other accredited universities, new students should request that college transcripts be sent directly to the Office of
Admissions at Taylor University. These transcripts are then forwarded to the Office of the Registrar for transfer credit evaluation; a copy of the evaluation is sent to
the student. The Office of the Registrar evaluates courses for foundational core and elective credit and confers with the appropriate department chair to have major
or minor courses evaluated for transfer credit. Course descriptions and syllabi may be required in order to evaluate transfer courses.
Current Students
After enrolling at Taylor, students who plan to take a course at another university during the summer or during a semester’s absence, and wish to transfer credit
to apply toward a degree, must complete a transfer credit course approval form signed by the student’s academic advisor, course department chair, and the Registrar
prior to enrolling in the course. The major or minor department chair’s signature may be required if the course is a major/minor requirement. Upon completion
of the course, students must request that an official transcript be sent directly to the Office of the Registrar at Taylor.
The guidelines for accepting transfer credit are as follows:
 Taylor University reserves the right to accept or reject
courses for transfer credit. Remedial or vocational
courses are not transferable.
 Accepting courses for transfer credit and applying them
toward various degree requirements are separate
considerations. Courses that transfer as elective credit
may not be applicable to specific requirements.
 Courses accepted for transfer, but not equivalent to a
Taylor University course, may be transferred in as 199
or 399 under the appropriate discipline; general
electives not eligible toward any program may be
transferred in as ELCT 199 or 399.
 Only course work with a grade of C- or better will be
accepted. Courses taken for a grade mode of pass,
credit or satisfactory do not transfer unless the
transcript indicates that the grade is equivalent to at
least a C-. Although a minimum grade is required,
grades do not transfer. The student’s GPA is computed
only on work offered by or through Taylor University.
 A maximum of 64 hours of credit may be transferred
from accredited colleges.
 Transfer credit will not be accepted and duplicate hours will not
be awarded for equivalent courses previously earned with a
grade of D- or better at Taylor. However, the grade on the
transfer institution’s transcript will be used to validate
completion of the course to meet a curriculum requirement
with the required grade. Students attempting to raise their
cumulative GPAs must repeat the respective course(s) at Taylor.
 The Director of Teacher Certification must approve courses
that apply toward teacher certification.
 Credit by examination (e.g., AP, CLEP, IB) recorded for a specific
course on an official transcript must meet Taylor standards in
order to be accepted for credit. Procedures for acceptance of
credit may be obtained from the Office of Academic
Assessment. Departmental challenge exams from other
institutions are not transferable.
 Graduation honors are computed only on Taylor University
course work.
 Degree residency requirements: (1) students must complete 50
percent of the minimum degree hours at Taylor University [e.g.,
64 of the minimum 128 hours required for the baccalaureate
degree; 32 of the minimum 64 hours required for the associate
degree]; (2) students must complete 50 percent of the major or
minor hours at Taylor University; and (3) at least 22 of the last
30 hours must be taken at Taylor University.
Transfer credit course approval forms are available online at http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/forms.shtml.
Transfer Credit Policy for Non-Taylor University Off-Campus/Study-Abroad Programs
Taylor University invests considerable time, effort, and resources for the creation of off-campus/study-abroad programs consistent with the standards
and educational objectives of the University and the needs of its students. Students wishing to receive credit from a study-abroad/off-campus program
not offered through Taylor University are responsible for initiating the approval process prior to program application to ensure approval of the program
and appropriate transfer of credits.
Taylor University will not enter into a consortium agreement with any foreign or domestic college/university or study-abroad/off-campus agency for
non-Taylor programs. No financial aid (federal, state, or institutional) will be awarded to students participating in non-Taylor programs.
Students must be in good academic standing and meet the following policies as they plan for and participate in any non-Taylor University study-abroad/off-campus program:
 Taylor University recommends that students begin the
program and course approval process one year prior to
the anticipated enrollment in any non-Taylor study-abroad
or off-campus program. Students should schedule an
appointment with the Registrar to initiate the application
process to meet all deadlines.
 The study-abroad/off-campus program must be sponsored
by other regionally accredited colleges or universities.
 Transfer credit will be accepted if prior approval has been
granted by the academic department, Coordinator of the
Foundational Core Curriculum, and Registrar. All course
approvals must be finalized by March 1, for the following
Summer or Fall, and October 1, for the following Spring.
 Course offerings and schedules are subject to change;
Taylor University cannot guarantee that course changes
will be accepted without the appropriate approvals prior
to attending the program.
 The sponsoring college/university must grant the credit
and grade for each course. Upon completion of the
approved course(s), an official transcript from the
sponsoring college/university should be sent to the Office
of the Registrar.
 No more than 17 credit hours will be approved for
semester-long programs.
 No more than 12 hours will be approved for Summer.
 22 of the last 30 credit hours must be completed through
Taylor University.
 Fifty percent of the degree hours must be completed
through Taylor University.
 Fifty percent of the major/minor hours must be completed
through Taylor University.
Additional information concerning transfer credit policies is available from the Office of the Registrar.

Transcript of Academic Record
In accordance with the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act of 1974 (FERPA), transcripts may not be released without the consent of the student. Students
request official transcripts by following the instructions available at http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/transcripts.shtml. Transcripts may not be
released unless all financial obligations to the University have been fulfilled according to an agreement with the Office of the Bursar.
Students may view an unofficial copy of their academic transcript via their TOWER accounts, provided all financial obligations to the University have been
fulfilled. This abstract is useful to students and academic advisors only; it is not an official transcript of academic record.
TOWER Online Access System
Taylor Online Web Enabled Records (TOWER) provides students secure online access to their academic records, including course registration, unofficial transcripts,
grades, 1098T, and limited student account information. Visit http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/tower.shtml for additional information on accessing TOWER.
TU Alert Emergency Messaging System
The TU Alert emergency messaging system will allow Taylor University to immediately notify students and employees of impending life-threatening or lifealtering situations including rapidly-developing, life-threatening criminal activity on campus and imminent severe weather activity. The system utilizes Wireless
Emergency Notification System (WENS) technology and can send text messages to cell phones and email messages to accounts of Taylor's students and
employees. TU Alert will never be used for advertising or spam.
Students may sign up for TU Alert at http://entry.inspironlogistics.com/taylor/wens.cfm?ep_id=student. Employees may sign up for TU Alert at
http://entry.inspironlogistics.com/taylor/wens.cfm?ep_id=employee.
Tutorials
A tutorial course is classroom-based, individualized instruction scheduled to meet on campus at a time that is mutually convenient for the student and the
professor. The contact hours for this course must meet the standard set by the appropriate School Dean. Any course listed in the catalog may be taught
as a tutorial course with the consent of the instructor and approval of the advisor, course department chair, and dean.
Tuition for tutorials completed during the summer is at the standard summer session credit hour rate. Check with the Financial Aid Office to inquire about
possible assistance for the summer term.
Registration forms for tutorials are available online at http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/forms.shtml. For additional information, please refer to
Specific Registration in the Registration section of this catalog.
University Communication Policy
Taylor University uses @TAYLOR.EDU student email addresses to communicate directives relating to academic progress, advising, registration, billing, housing,
financial aid, etc. to students, faculty, and staff. Students are responsible for checking their Taylor email accounts regularly and complying with correspondence
received from University administrators, advisors, faculty, and staff.
University Withdrawal
Students with no intent to return to Taylor for the next term must apply for formal withdrawal through the Academic Enrichment Center before leaving campus
(prior to exam week).
Students who decide they cannot attend Taylor after enrollment in courses for the next term and prior to the start of that term must notify the Academic Enrichment
Center. Students failing to request withdrawal from the University risk receiving failing grades in their courses and being financially responsible for tuition
fees (Summer courses included).
Students who find it necessary to withdraw from all credit classes after the semester begins must apply for formal withdrawal through the Academic Enrichment Center. If
a student withdraws from the University after the first week of classes (first five class days), he/she will receive a withdrawal grade (W, WP, WF) for the appropriate
withdrawal deadline. If this procedure is not followed, failing grades may be assigned. Failure to complete the term does not cancel the student’s obligation to pay
tuition and other charges. For specific details on refunds and adjustments, refer to the Finance section of this catalog.
Students withdrawing with the intent to return to Taylor must initiate the withdrawal process through the Academic Enrichment Center and apply for readmission
through the Office of Admissions. Students planning to take courses at another institution during their time away from Taylor University should submit
transfer credit request forms to the Office of the Registrar before registering for courses at the other university to ensure proper credit will be granted by
Taylor.
To withdraw from a single course, students should contact the Office of the Registrar for details.
27
Registration
It is the responsibility of each student to follow directives published annually relating to registration, housing, billing, payment of bills, financial aid, etc. While
Taylor University publishes program information and materials and assigns academic advisors, students are solely responsible for ensuring their academic
programs comply with University policies. Any advice that is at variance with established policy must be verified and confirmed by the Registrar.
Course offerings (including changes in time, day, and the assignment of instructors) may be added to, amended, or canceled by the decision of a department or
the University.
Registration deadlines, directives, and regulations are published each semester in the online academic calendar and schedule of classes available at
http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/registration.shtml. Contact the Office of the Registrar for additional details regarding course registration.
Advance Registration
Advance registration provides an opportunity for degree-seeking students to register via the registration app for courses for the upcoming semester(s).
Registration priority is determined by cumulative earned credit hours with priority given to students with the most hours. Students who fail to register
during their assigned advance registration period will lose their priority position during the registration process.
To ensure correct billing and certification of enrollment status for state and federal financial aid, scholarships, loan deferments, NAIA athletic eligibility, etc.,
students must be enrolled for at least 12 credit hours by the end of each advance registration period.
Readmitted students will be contacted by the Registrar’s Office regarding registration procedures and will be required to meet with their academic advisors
to pre-approve their upcoming schedules. The advisor must submit the approved class schedule to the Registrar by the published deadline in order to
receive priority registration.
Guest students are not eligible for advance priority registration.
Audit Registration
Audit registration requires the approvals of the academic advisor and instructor and is subject to the following guidelines:
 Courses taken for audit receive no academic credit or grade.
 The audit option must be declared during the first week of classes
(first five class days of Fall or Spring semester classes).
 Students must attend at least 50 percent of the class meetings as
verified by the instructor in order for the course to appear on the
academic transcript.
 At the discretion of the instructor, students may be required to
complete course assignments, projects, etc., in order to
participate in a course taken for audit credit.
 Audit registration occurs after all students requesting credit for
the course have been given priority registration.
 Some courses are not available for audit registration such as
private music lessons, music ensembles, laboratory courses,
experiential education (e.g., practicum, internship, and field and travel
studies), studio art courses, physical education courses, off-campus
program courses, and distance education courses (e.g., Blackboard,
online, independent study, and correspondence).
 Language courses required for the BA degree may not be
taken for audit credit.
 Audit hours will be charged if the student’s registration is
under 12 hours or exceeds 17 hours for the enrollment term.
 Courses taken for audit do not count toward determining
part-time or full-time status for enrollment status.
 Students must not register for the audit course. Upon
approval, the Office of the Registrar will add the course to
the student’s schedule after the end of the advance
registration period.
 The “Audit Registration” form must be pre-approved by the
academic advisor and instructor before submission to the
Registrar.
Registration forms for audit courses are available online at http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/forms.shtml.
Holds on Registration
The University uses several methods in the registration process to ensure that students are eligible to enroll in courses:
Bursar
 If a student fails to meet payment requirements by the due date, the Bursar may place a hold on the student’s records and course registration
until the problem is resolved.
 The student will not be permitted to register for a subsequent term and will lose his or her priority registration position. Graduating seniors are
not exempt from registration holds.
 It is the student’s responsibility to view his or her account on both TOWER and the secure billing site to remain informed of his or her financial
status.
 It is extremely important that each student communicates with the Bursar about unresolved account balances.
28
Health Center
 If a student fails to submit complete health forms, immunization records, certification of physical examination, etc., the Office of Student
Development may place a hold on the student’s records and course registration until the issue is resolved.
 The student will not be permitted to register for a subsequent term and will lose his or her priority registration position.
 The Health Center or Office of Student Development should send the student notification of such a hold prior to the advance registration period.
Registrar
 The Registrar may place a hold on a student’s registration due to, but not limited to, academic standing, athletic eligibility, graduation progress,
placement results, proficiency requirements, and repeat registration.
Students should contact the respective office who initiated the registration hold well in advance of the advance registration period. Until the hold is removed
from the student’s record, he or she will not be permitted to register for a subsequent term and will lose his or her priority registration position.
Music Lesson Registration
All students—music majors, minors, and those taking lessons to meet the foundational core participation in the arts—are encouraged to register for private
music lessons via the registration app during the advance registration period. Lesson days/times will be arranged using class schedules during the first week
of the semester. Students will receive email notifications of their lesson days/times and instructor assignments. No changes of schedule for music lessons
will be permitted after the end of the second week of the semester.
Contact the music coordinators (Dr. Patricia Robertson—Voice; Dr. Leon Harshenin—Piano (Keyboard); Lisa Royal—Instrumental) for additional assistance
with private music lessons.
Non-Music Majors
Non-music majors may register for a ½-hour lesson (1 credit hour) via the registration app during the advance registration period. Lessons are designed
for non-music majors for personal enrichment and development of musical talent and to meet the foundational core participation in the arts requirement.
Private instruction content will be determined by contract with instructors at the beginning of the semester.

Overrides
Departmental requirements on course restrictions are firm; however, a student may merit an exception based upon individual circumstances. Students must
contact the course instructor for an override approval. Registration overrides are possible for the following restrictions:
 Academic Load (Registrar authorization required)
 Closed Section
 Class
 Major/Minor
 Prerequisite, including Test Score
 Instructor Permission
 Time Conflict (both instructors must enter overrides for their respective courses)
If an override exception is deemed appropriate by the instructor or department, the instructor is to enter the section override(s) in the system. Upon
entering the required override, the instructor should notify and remind the student of the student’s responsibility to then register for the course. An override
is an authorization to enroll in a course—not a registration request or schedule adjustment. The student is solely responsible for registering for course(s) within the
registration period once an override has been entered by the instructor. Students may be required to manually enter the CRN in order to register for the course, especially
if the course is closed (full).
Pass/Fail Registration
The pass/fail option requires the approvals of the academic advisor and instructor and is subject to the following guidelines:
 A pass grade represents work completed at C- or above.
 The pass/fail option is open only to second-term sophomores
or above with a minimum 2.30 GPA.
 No course needed for teacher certification may be taken
pass/fail.
 No course in the major, minor, or concentration field
(excluding courses available only as pass/fail), and no
foundational core course may be taken pass/fail until all
requirements in those areas are met.
 Language courses required for the BA degree are not eligible
for the pass/fail option.
 The pass/fail option must be officially declared no later than
the first week of classes (first five class days of Fall or Spring
semester classes).
 Pass/fail courses do not affect the cumulative GPA if passed;
however, they do affect the GPA if failed.
 Pass/fail courses are limited to one course per term (excluding
courses available only as pass/fail).
 Pass/fail courses are limited to a total of 13 hours (excluding
courses available only as pass/fail).
 The student is responsible for registering for the course.
Upon approval, the Office of the Registrar will change the
grade mode from normal to pass/fail.
 The “Pass/Fail Registration” form must be pre-approved by
the academic advisor and instructor before submission to the
Registrar.
Registration forms for pass/fail courses are available online at http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/forms.shtml.
Pre-Registration Advising
Students must meet with their academic advisors during the pre-registration advising period to receive their registration PIN. A student with double majors
in different disciplines should be advised by both the primary and secondary advisors; the academic advisor for the primary major should provide the PIN.
Registration time tickets will be emailed to students prior to the advisement period.
While Taylor University publishes program information and materials and assigns academic advisors, students are solely responsible for ensuring that their
academic programs comply with the policies of the University. Any advice that is at variance with established policy must be verified and confirmed by the
Registrar.
30
Repeat Registration
Any course may be repeated at Taylor University. All attempts in a course are reflected on the student’s academic transcript; the cumulative GPA will
include the most recent grade* in the repeated course, even if the new grade is lower than the original attempt. Athletes and students receiving financial
aid, should inquire about eligibility for repeated courses. Previously awarded credit hours are excluded when repeating a course.
*Grades of W (withdrawn), WP (withdrawn/passing), or AUD (audit) will not replace previously earned grades of A-F, WF (withdrawn/failing), or NC (no credit) in the
GPA calculation.
Specific Registration
Specific registration forms are required for the following courses:
 Audit
 Departmental Honors
 Directed Research
 Field Study
 Independent Study
 Internship
 Pass/Fail
 Practicum
 Selected Topics
 TU Online
 Tutorial
Registration forms are available online at http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/forms.shtml. Completed forms must be pre-approved with signatures
of the instructor, academic advisor, and major and course department chairs (if applicable) before submission to the Registrar for evaluation and registration.
Registration forms must be received by the registration (add/drop) deadline.
Schedule Adjustments
Students are solely responsible for each course in which they register and for notifying their advisors of any schedule adjustments. Students must verify
their official schedules prior to the first day of classes and the last day to drop/add courses to confirm their registration. Students are not authorized to
attend classes for which they are not officially enrolled.
Courses may be added during the first week of classes (first five class days of Fall/Spring semesters); however, each class missed that week counts as an
unexcused absence. After the first week of classes, no additional coursework may be added or changed. Courses may be dropped during the first five class
days via the registration app, if enabled; if disabled, students must initiate registration changes through the Office of the Registrar. Specific add/drop deadlines
apply to Summer, Interterm, and partial-term courses; refer to the academic calendar for the respective term.
After the first week of classes (first five class days of Fall/Spring semesters), withdrawing from a course requires submission of a course withdrawal form available
from the Office of the Registrar. It is the student’s responsibility to formally withdraw from courses. Discontinuance of attendance does not automatically
constitute withdrawal from a course. Students failing to file proper withdrawal forms by the appropriate deadline must complete classes for which they are
registered or receive an automatic grade of F. Withdrawing from courses during the second and third weeks of the semester appears on the student’s
transcript with a grade of withdrawn (W). Students withdrawing from a course after this period and up to one week after midterm receive either a grade
of withdrawn/passing (WP) or withdrawn/failing (WF). When a student withdraws from a course later than one week beyond midterm, the grade is
automatically WF. The effect of WF on the GPA carries the same weight as that of a full-term failing grade. Course withdrawals are not permitted during
the week of final exams.
The official process of withdrawing from a course (after the last day to drop a class without a transcript entry) begins in the Registrar’s Office; notifying instructors
and advisors of intent to withdraw from a course does not automatically constitute course withdrawal. Students are solely responsible for formally
withdrawing from a course. Neither failure to pay nor failure to attend will automatically remove a student from a course. Students failing to properly
withdraw from a course risk owing the University all tuition and fees, repayment of financial aid, and failing grades in those courses.
Drop from Full- to Part-Time Hours
A full refund will be given to students dropping from full-time to part-time by the last date to drop a class without a transcript entry. There is no refund for
dropped hours after this date as outlined in the academic calendar. Contact the Office of Student Accounts for further details on refund policies.
Drop of Overload/Audit Hours
After the last day to drop a class without a transcript entry, students registered for 18 hours or more will not have the amount of their fees reduced if they
withdraw from a course (including private lessons, ensembles, and audit). Students are solely responsible for adhering to the registration deadlines outlined
in the academic calendar, registration procedures, and catalog. Contact the Office of Student Accounts for further details on refund policies.

Degree Requirements
Taylor University offers programs leading to the degrees Bachelor of Arts, Bachelor of Science, Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Fine Arts, or Associate of
Arts.
All degrees require students to fulfill foundational core and major field courses. Students must declare a major by the time they reach junior status (61
hours). Students must also demonstrate proficiency in the essential skill areas: reading, math, and writing.
In situations where curricular changes must be made in compliance with new licensing or credential requirements, students will be required to comply with
new requirements. Otherwise, in view of occasional curricular changes, continuously attending students may elect to meet the graduation requirements
that were in effect at the time they entered Taylor University or may elect to declare a subsequent year’s catalog requirements. All programs completed
by a student must be under the same catalog year.
While there is no official time limit for the completion of a degree for continuously attending students, those students who interrupt their enrollment for
three consecutive semesters are required to meet the degree requirements current at the time of readmission. Students who wish to return after missing
a semester(s) must contact the Office of Admissions for details on applying for readmission. While most courses that are equivalent to current course
offerings will be accepted toward a degree, courses that are more than ten years old at the time of readmission typically will not be counted toward meeting
degree requirements; when appropriate, students may request an exception to this policy if justification exists for the acceptance of credit older than ten
years. All coursework taken through Taylor University will remain on the official transcript and be calculated into the grade point average (GPA).
Baccalaureate Degree Requirements
A baccalaureate degree is an award that requires the completion of at least four academic years of college-level work or the equivalent in an academic field
of study and that meets the institutional standards for satisfying the requirements of this degree level. Additional majors, minors, or concentrations cannot
be added to a previously awarded degree.
The Bachelor of Arts degree centers on courses of study in the arts and sciences. Candidates for the Bachelor of Arts degree must demonstrate the
equivalent of two years of sequential college-level study in one foreign language.
The Bachelor of Fine Arts degree is a professional baccalaureate degree in the arts with an emphasis on practical studio work alongside classroom work in
the major field of specialized focus.
The Bachelor of Music degree is the initial professional baccalaureate degree in music. Its primary emphasis is on development of skills, concepts, and
sensitivity essential to the professional life of a musician.
The Bachelor of Science degree typically requires more upper-division courses, fewer electives, and a practicum or internship experience. Bachelor of
Science degrees are often awarded to students preparing for professional fields. Many Bachelor of Science degree programs are available only when
combined with curriculum requirements in education or information systems and analytics.
Students must make application and receive approval of both departments before adding concurrent majors/minors; adding a third major or minor requires
approval of the three departments’ chairs, the Academic Policy Committee, and the Registrar.
The following requirements apply to the baccalaureate program:
 Minimum of 128 semester hours
 Minimum of 42 semester hours of upper-division (300-/400-
level) courses
 The residency requirement for the awarding of a Taylor
University degree is fifty percent of the minimum degree
requirement
 At least 22 of the last 30 hours earned toward the degree
must be taken in residence at Taylor University
 Completion of all foundational core requirements
 Completion of all requirements for selected major(s) and
minor(s)
 Demonstration of proficiency in reading and mathematics
 Cumulative GPA of 2.00
 Passing grade in all hours for graduation
 Grade of C- or better for all major, minor, systems, and
education requirements
 Students desiring to complete the requirements for two
degrees (e.g., BA and BS) must make application and receive
approval from both departments and the Registrar
 Candidates for two degrees (e.g., BA and BS) must complete
a minimum of 158 semester hours and meet requirements
for two different majors

Information Systems and Analytics for Bachelor of Science Degree
Co-Directors, Jon Denning and Stefan Brandle
The Information Systems and Analytics curriculum distinguishes Taylor University from other liberal arts colleges. The curriculum complements many
majors by sharpening students’ analytical skills, introducing students to technology and data analytics, teaching how world-class enterprises achieve
quality, and providing insights into managing organizations and people. The goal of the curriculum is to help students recognize that the world is filled
with systems (e.g., educational systems, distribution systems, manufacturing systems) and that it is the processes inhabiting these systems that produce
value. World-class organizations are the ones that can hone processes to achieve high performance. Our graduates are enjoying careers at enterprises
of all sizes and in all segments of the economy.
The four major themes of the curriculum are analysis, information technology, operations, and quality. Much of the curriculum is taught by faculty
from the Computer Science and Engineering Department. However, the Information Systems and Analytics curriculum is not a minor in computer
science. A goal of the curriculum is to give students an in-depth exposure to system development, because this experience is essential for future
systems analysts, managers, and anyone who will work in a world-class organization. Most systems analysts will never write a line of computer code
in their professional careers, but they will undoubtedly manage projects involving application software where first-hand knowledge of software
development and implementation is vitally important. (Some students do discover they actually are very good programmers and do look for
programming opportunities upon graduation.)
Successful Information Systems and Analytics students are problem solvers and are analytically minded. These general traits may and do describe
many in the liberal arts: artists, musicians, historians, theologians, philosophers, and writers to name a few. That is why the Information Systems and
Analytics curriculum is combined with many baccalaureate majors. The skills acquired in the curriculum are not only applicable to almost any
professional endeavor but also to living life: rational decision making, human relations, and problem solving. Graduates have used what they have
learned in systems in a variety of arenas, beyond a career in systems analysis. For example, anyone aspiring for an MBA will be very well prepared
upon graduating Taylor with the completion of the Information Systems and Analytics curriculum; psychologists and sociologists have used what they
learned to conduct studies regarding human behavior. The broad applicability of systems knowledge makes the curriculum a practical enhancement
to the many majors offering this curriculum under the Bachelor of Science degree.
All courses required by the Information Systems and Analytics curriculum must be completed with a grade of C- or better.
For description of systems courses, refer to Information Systems and Analytics Courses located in the Computer Science and Engineering section of this catalog.

Associate of Arts Degree
An Associate of Arts degree is an award that requires the completion of at least two academic years of college-level work, or the equivalent, in an
academic or occupationally specific field of study and meets institutional standards for satisfying the requirements for this degree level.
The Associate of Arts degree requires foundational core and major/specialty area courses, along with demonstrated proficiency in essential skill areas.
At Taylor University, many of the degree programs are designed to prepare students for occupational-specific fields. An Associate of Arts degree
must be completed and awarded one calendar year before a baccalaureate degree from the same department can be awarded. The Associate of Arts
in liberal arts is not to be taken with or awarded with any baccalaureate degree.
The following requirements apply to the associate’s degree:
 Minimum of 64 semester hours.
 The residency requirement for the awarding of a Taylor degree
is fifty percent of the minimum degree requirement.
 At least 22 of the last 30 hours must be taken in residence at
Taylor University.
 Cumulative GPA of 2.00.
 Demonstrated proficiency in writing, mathematics, and reading.
 The following foundational core courses: IAS 110; ENG 110; CAS
110 or 120; KIN 100 and 200_; BIB 110 and 210; COS 104; one
social science or history course; HUM 230 or a literature course
from ENG 230, 233, 240, or 250; one science or math course; and
fulfillment of all major/specialty area requirements. (Refer to
Liberal Arts within academic departments for detailed listings.)
 This degree does not allow for more than one major area of study.
35
Foundational Core
Jeffry Cramer, Coordinator of Foundational Core
The liberal arts at Taylor University provide an entrance into a human dialogue about life’s important questions and allow the opportunity to appreciate
God’s wisdom and beauty. Such a focus enables students to acquire knowledge concerning their faith in order to become better ambassadors for Christ.
The practice of engaging a breadth of disciplines trains students to become intellectually open to new ideas as they acquire discernment and self-control.
Studying the liberal arts allows students to develop a sense of purpose and meaning as they fulfill the biblical obligation of pursuing God with their minds
while striving to become more like Christ. At Taylor, Christian faith is the foundation for the development of knowledge. All academic disciplines, in turn,
inform the development of faith as well as habits of mind and action that characterize mature Christians.
The Foundational Core Curriculum at Taylor University challenges students to pursue knowledge outside of their chosen disciplines so they may make
connections between disciplines, between the past and the present, and between their experiences and the experiences of others. Students dedicated to
inquisitiveness, intellectual honesty, and the pursuit of truth, while demonstrating the willingness to persevere when applications are not immediate and
obvious, develop the foundation to continue learning throughout their lives. Christians who value lifelong learning are intrinsically motivated to pursue
God’s wisdom, truth, and love.
In this light, the Foundational Core Curriculum emphasizes the Christian calling to recognize the global realities and complexities of local, national and
international issues and situations in order to develop ethical positions that are informed, thoughtful and nuanced. Students will grow in their understanding
of global realities from historical and cross-cultural perspectives and appreciate diverse cultural dynamics and orientations. Through coursework and
personal interaction, students may develop the discernment to choose actions that promote global responsibility and uphold the dignity and worth of all
people.¹
Seven Objectives for the Foundational Core Curriculum
1. Aesthetic Literacy
Aesthetic literacy entails the capacity to effectively engage the arts (which include literature, music, architecture, and the visual, performing, and media arts)
and the aesthetic dimensions found in natural phenomena and to comprehend the ways in which they contribute to culture and human flourishing. It requires
a grasp of the distinctive nature of the relationship between form and meaning found in works of art and the knowledge of the critical frameworks relevant
to their understanding. Aesthetic literacy enables students to recognize and develop their gifts as humans who share the image of a creative God. It invests
them with the ability to engage works of art and aesthetic form in diverse contexts with discernment in order to foster a way of life that is both vibrant and
in keeping with God’s purposes.
Outcomes
1. Students will identify the distinctive characteristics of a variety of the arts, artists, styles, cultures, and historical periods.
2. Students will explain how values and meaning are embedded in artistic form and design by using appropriate methods to evaluate and discern worth and
ethical implications in historical and current art practice.
3. Students will explore their own creative potential as both participants and observers, enabling future involvement with the arts.
2. Civic Mindedness
Civic mindedness involves an understanding of ideals and practices of citizenship critical to full participation in a democratic society. Greater global
interdependence, illustrated by the volume of international news, communication, trade, and travel, requires more awareness of a variety of social, political,
and economic systems throughout the world. Informed citizens need to have a systematic knowledge of the structure and processes of economic, political,
and social systems, as applicable in a local, national, or international context. Civic mindedness entails citizens valuing knowledgeable participation in the
public forum for the public good.
Outcomes
1. Students will acquire knowledge of political and economic systems, and of diverse cultures and subcultures to understand current events and to have an
informed opinion of these issues.
2. Students will assess, analyze, and knowledgeably participate in public discourse.
3. Students will respect and evaluate diverse opinions related to local, national, and international issues.
4. As a portion of their Christian responsibility, students will participate in local, national, and international institutions and civic organizations in order to
fulfill God’s mandate to be salt and light to the world.
3. Communication Fluency
Effective communication involves an awareness of rhetorical strategies and practices essential to conveying understanding in public and private discourse.
Such communication requires that issues and ideas be examined from a variety of oral and written perspectives and contexts. Communication fluency is
evidenced by proficiency in analyzing and applying audience-specific, message-specific, context-specific, and medium-specific factors in the formulation of
meaning.
Outcomes
1. Students will investigate and gain knowledge of media literacy, including the development of research techniques and critical reading strategies, to
incorporate selected sources into their own work.
2. Students will analyze rhetorical models, and respond to ideas using appropriate patterns of reasoning, supportive evidence, and appropriate evaluative
standards.
3. Students will apply oral and written language usage and media selection appropriate to particular rhetorical situations and particular audiences.

36
4. Critical Thinking and Information Literacy
Strong critical thinkers have the ability to access, identify, evaluate, and analyze information, concepts, assumptions, and perspectives toward the end of
discovering truth and achieving relevant results. Critical thinking also requires the ability to determine the quality and the extent of information for the
discovery of knowledge within a variety of academic disciplines. These skills enable students to form scholarly, sophisticated, and ethical considerations
marked by integrity, fairness, empathy for others’ perspectives, and openness to self-criticism. Additionally, advancing critical thinking and research skills
better enables students to make informed contributions to society and scholarly conversations using diverse forms of media.
Outcomes
1. Students will analyze an event, argument, or problem using appropriate evidence and reasoned judgments.
2. Students will evaluate and synthesize information from diverse resources to reach an informed conclusion.
3. Students will identify and assess their own and others’ biases and values.
4. Students will apply new and prior information to a specific purpose, problem, or research question.
5. Quantitative and Scientific Literacy
Quantitative and scientific literacy involves theoretical, experimental, observational, and computational exploration in the context of collaboration; this
entails problem solving in teams and communicating the results in a clear and logical way. Quantitative and scientific literacy enables students to explore
God’s creation, investigate contemporary human challenges, and use technology thoughtfully in the context of human interaction. Wise and ethical decisions
that demonstrate effective stewardship of our God-given resources are the hallmark of quantitative and scientific literacy.
Outcomes
1. Students will apply quantitative and scientific models to solve real-world problems.
2. Students will clearly communicate quantitative and scientific results using words, tables, graphs, and other formats as appropriate for the intended audience.
3. Students will articulate the value of natural science, mathematics, and computational technology as a means of understanding their world.
4. Students will identify, and explain, the importance of the ethical uses of science and technology in their everyday lives.
6. Responsible Stewardship
Stewardship entails respect of and responsible oversight for that which belongs to another. Christian stewardship recognizes God as Creator and Owner of
all things and Endower of our skills, abilities, talents, and resources. The response of the believer should be to manage purposefully all spiritual, intellectual,
natural, personal, economic, technological, and physical resources provided by God with individual and social responsibility. This responsibility involves
acknowledging the costs and benefits of such stewardship. As the intended caretaker, humankind is commissioned to devise and employ strategies to care
for God’s creation. Responsible stewardship also includes using one’s body, time, talents, and personal resources in a God-honoring manner in one’s vocation
and personal ministry to others; one’s physical, social, and spiritual wellbeing; and one’s service to Him and to others in the world in which we live.
Outcomes
1. Students will explain the scope of responsible Christian stewardship for all that God has created.
2. Students will demonstrate responsible use of their minds, bodies, abilities, and resources.
3. Students will identify the costs and benefits involved in the wise, responsible, moderate, and sustainable use of their resources.
4. Students will practice wise stewardship of creation in their personal lives, vocations and ministries in their communities and the world to honor God and
to serve others.
7. Spiritual Maturity
Spiritual maturity is the mark of a vibrant, personalized, growing faith in Jesus Christ. Students who are spiritually mature have developed a solid faith
foundation, grounded in the knowledge of Scripture in its entirety, which they intentionally integrate into every aspect of their lives. This is primarily exhibited
in Christ-like character (or the fruit of the Spirit), and the regular practice of spiritual disciplines including prayer, Bible study, corporate and personal
worship, stewardship, and service. The Foundational Core Curriculum will provide students with the skills by which they are able to formulate and support
a personal, growing, evangelical, orthodox Christian faith.
Outcomes
1. Students will articulate the biblical foundations of their faith and explain how they impact daily life.
2. Students will practice biblical principles of a growing Christian faith as evidenced by spiritual disciplines.
3. Students will express the philosophical and theological arguments which shaped the doctrinal understandings of the Christian faith.
4. Students will assess cultural values and practices in the light of biblical theology to influence culture for the Kingdom of God.

Proficiencies
English/Writing Proficiency and Requirements
Writing Placement
In order to ensure writing success at Taylor, all students will place into the freshman writing course that best meets their needs as college writers: ENG 101
Fundamentals of College Composition or ENG 110 College Composition.
Most students’ writing placement is determined by using SAT Critical Reading or ACT English test scores and the high school GPA. Students whose
combined scores are high will be placed into ENG 110 (unless they choose to attempt CLEP or AP credit); students whose combined scores are not high
will be placed into ENG 101; except for multilingual students who will be placed in a special section and the reading proficiency (if required) shall be deemed
completed when this special section is completed with a C- or higher. English-speaking international students (including missionary kids and other third-culture
kids) who place into ENG 101 but would prefer to take the special section for multilingual students are welcome to do so since it will focus on American academic writing
and reading preparation). Any international student who is placed into ENG 110 but does not pass the reading proficiency will be placed into AEC 140, the
academic reading course.
After receiving his or her placement, if a student believes that he or she has been placed into the wrong writing course—either at too high or too low of a
level—the student should contact the Advising Office. The student will be given an online writing test to complete. Then, the chair of the English department
and the writing center director will evaluate this writing sample, along with the SAT/ACT test scores and high school GPA in order to determine if the
writing placement should be changed. The student will receive an email within two weeks of completing the writing test notifying him or her of the final
writing placement. In order to have the writing placement altered, the writing test should be completed by August 1. Following August 1, it is unlikely any
placements can be altered.
Students who do not have SAT/ACT scores must also complete a writing test to help determine writing placement. Placement will be decided based on the
writing test and the high school GPA. Students should contact the Advising Office to receive the writing test.
Writing Requirements
Taylor University believes that writing plays a significant role in both learning and communication; thus, Taylor has several writing requirements.
First, all students must meet ENG 110 College Composition in their first year at Taylor. Some students must complete ENG 101 Fundamentals of
College Composition (Fall semester) prior to College Composition (Spring semester). These writing courses set the foundation for the collegelevel writing that will be expected at Taylor. Second, a large number of Taylor’s foundational core courses incorporate writing in some way, from
short in-class writing to research papers. Third, every student will experience a substantial amount of writing in their major, most of which will be
discipline-specific writing to prepare students for the kind of writing they will need in their careers. All students, both first-time freshmen and
transfer students, are expected to complete ENG 110 College Composition by the end of their first year.
Transfer Credit for ENG 110
Writing courses transferred from other institutions to meet ENG 110 must represent the total writing requirement at that college or university (the last
course in a sequence if more than one semester is offered). The course should include process writing, finished essays, and a research paper. The Registrar’s
Office (in consultation with the English department at Taylor) must approve transfer courses.
AP Credit for ENG 110
An AP score of 5 qualifies for credit, while a score of 4 requires evaluation of the essay by the English department at Taylor University. If a score of 4 is
received, it is the student’s responsibility to request that AP send the free response booklet essay. The student then needs to submit the free response
booklet essay to the Testing Office. The AP process must be completed with the Testing Office before October 15, for students entering in the Fall
semester, or March 15, for those entering in the Spring semester.
CLEP Credit for ENG 110
Students wishing to attempt CLEP credit must have scores at or above 35 in SAT Reading (taken after March 2016), 660 in SAT Critical Reading (taken prior
to March 2016), or 27 in ACT English. A scaled score of 50 or higher on the CLEP College Composition Modular exam qualifies a student to write an essay
evaluated by the department of English. The CLEP exam must be taken and passed by October 15 for students entering in the Fall semester and March 15
for students entering in the Spring semester. Students not completing all requirements by the appropriate date must register for ENG 110 in their second
semester at Taylor.
If the AP or CLEP exam for ENG 110 College Composition is passed and approved by the Office of Academic Assessment, the fee for posting credit to the transcript must
be paid by November 1, for those entering in the Fall semester, and April 1, for those entering in the Spring semester. Students are solely responsible for verifying that
their scores are received in the Office of Academic Assessment.
Reading and Math Proficiencies
All new students, both first-time freshmen and transfer students, must demonstrate proficiency in reading and mathematics. The main purpose of these
proficiency requirements is to ensure that all students are prepared to successfully complete coursework at Taylor. Proficiency tests are administered at
student orientations during the summer, Welcome Weekend, and the first week of the Fall and Spring semesters.
All students must fulfill the reading and math proficiency requirements according to the following guidelines:
Reading
Students with an SAT Reading score of 29 or above taken after March 2016, SAT Critical Reading score of 540 or above taken prior to March 2016, or ACT
English score of 23 or above are considered to have met the reading proficiency requirement.
Students without a sufficient SAT or ACT score will be registered for AEC 140 Academic Reading. Students will have the opportunity to test out of AEC
140 during Summer Orientation or Welcome Weekend by passing the reading proficiency exam with a score of at least 13.0. Students can satisfy the reading
proficiency by completing AEC 140 with a grade of C- or better.
Math
Students with an SAT math score of 570 or above taken after March 2016, SAT math score of 550 or above taken prior to March 2016, or ACT math score
of 24 or above are considered to have met the math proficiency requirement.
Students without sufficient SAT or ACT scores are required to attain a passing score of at least 35 on the math proficiency exam. Students in this group
who do not pass the proficiency exam will be enrolled in MAT 100 Mathematics Fundamentals. Failure to pass the exam as part of the course will require
re-enrollment in MAT 100 for the following term.
No math course, including Taylor and transfer credit, will meet the math proficiency requirement.
39
Majors and Minors
Major
The major is the principal field of study usually consisting of 35 percent or more of the total hours required in an undergraduate curriculum. At
Taylor University, fields of study require students to earn a minimum of 30 hours of credit. The following requirements apply to the major:
 A 2.30 GPA in the major field is required. Higher GPAs are
required in certain curricula (e.g., social work).
 Only courses with a grade of C- or better will count in satisfying
major requirements.
 The major GPA is calculated to include all courses that could be
counted toward the major, including courses in which a grade
below C- is earned. This includes courses taken in
concentrations, tracks, education, and systems. Note that some
majors require students to take some courses (including courses
offered by other departments) which do not count in the major
GPA.
 If a major course is normally taken for a letter grade (A-F), the
course cannot be counted in the major if taken pass/fail.
 Fifty percent of the hours in the major field must be earned
through Taylor University.
 A comprehensive examination, paper, or project in each major
field of study must be successfully completed.
 Students must make application and receive approval from
each department before adding concurrent majors.
Concentration
A concentration is an intensive study of a subject within a major field of study. At Taylor University, concentrations are specialized areas within the
major field and include tracks, application fields, supporting areas, and areas of emphasis. There is a range of required hours determined by standards
within the field, along with requirements established by the department.

Graduation
Applying to Graduate
Candidates for graduation should apply to graduate at least one year prior to the anticipated graduation date: May 1 for Spring/Summer graduates and
December 1 for Fall/Interterm graduates. This student-initiated step begins the graduation tracking process.
The student and advisor should utilize My TU Degree to review all outstanding requirements for graduation. Once the student applies to graduate, the Director
of Graduation will review the progress toward graduation for the student during summer (for Spring/Summer graduates) or January (for Fall/Interterm graduates).
Any outstanding requirement shown should be addressed by March 1 for Commencement participants and all requirements must be met for degree conferral.
Students anticipating a Summer completion must register for or notify the Director of Graduation of all planned Summer courses by April 15 prior to
Commencement.
If deficiencies exist in My TU Degree, the student will not be eligible for participation in Commencement; it is the student’s responsibility to notify his or her
family. If the deficiencies are addressed and My TU Degree shows no outstanding requirements (with the exception of the senior comprehensive requirement,
departmental participation, and planned Summer courses not to exceed 8 credit hours) by April 15, the student will be eligible to participate in Commencement.
Students addressing deficiencies after April 15 but up to one week prior to Commencement, may request permission to participate in Commencement; however,
the student might not be included in the Commencement program even if approved to participate.
Students with two additional semesters remaining for graduation should visit http://public.taylor.edu/academics/registrar/graduation.shtml for details regarding
applying to graduate. The preferred deadline for applying is May 1 (Spring/Summer graduates) or December 1 (Fall/Interterm graduates). Students are solely
responsible for ensuring that their academic programs comply with the policies of the University and meet all graduation requirements.
Commencement and Diplomas
A student may complete graduation requirements and officially graduate at the end of any Taylor University instructional terms concluding in December, January,
May, June, July, or August. Only one Commencement ceremony is held—in May at the end of the Spring term. Attendance at Commencement is expected;
however, if a graduate is unable to participate, written notification of in absentia must be submitted to the Director of Graduation by April 15. Students are
eligible to participate in a maximum of one Commencement per level of degree. Graduates subsequently completing a higher degree at Taylor would be eligible
to participate in Commencement again.
A Summer graduation candidate should participate in Commencement if no more than 8 credit hours remain and the student notifies the Director of Graduation by
April 15 of all planned Summer courses to be completed by the respective official Summer graduation date. Fall and Interterm graduates are eligible to participate in
the ceremony following their official graduation. Any exceptions must be approved by the School Dean after the student has applied to graduate.
Any outstanding course, including incompletes, will prevent the conferral of the degree. A student intending to take additional courses beyond graduation
must apply as a guest student or extend the graduation date. Diplomas should be mailed to graduates within three weeks of the conferral date following
submission of final grades and completion of the final degree audit by the Office of the Registrar. Graduates must fulfill all financial obligations to the
University before receiving a diploma.
Honors
In recognition of superior scholarship, the University awards three levels of honors at graduation: summa cum laude, magna cum laude, and cum laude. Summa
cum laude is awarded to those with a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.90; or magna cum laude is awarded to those students with a minimum cumulative GPA
of 3.70; or cum laude is awarded to those students with a cumulative GPA of at least 3.50.
Graduation honors placed on diplomas and transcripts are designated for those students who have fully completed all course work and requirements for
their baccalaureate degrees. Graduation honors are computed on Taylor University credit hours only; fifty percent of the minimum degree hours must be
completed through Taylor University. Associate and Master degrees are not eligible to receive honors.
For Commencement ceremony purposes only, honors will be announced and appropriate honors regalia worn using the cumulative GPA calculated after
January interterm. No grades from Spring (immediately preceding Commencement) will be used in calculating honors for Commencement.
Major/Minor GPA Calculation
Only courses with a grade of C- or better will count in satisfying major/minor credit hour requirements. However, the institutional methodology for computing
the major or minor GPA will be to include all courses that could be counted toward the major/minor, including courses in which a grade below C- is earned.
This includes excessive major electives and courses taken in concentrations, tracks, education, and systems. For courses that have been repeated through Taylor due
to an unsatisfactory grade, the previous attempt is excluded from GPA calculations and credit totals, but remains on the transcript.
All major and minor programs will continue to have a 2.30 major and minor GPA requirement with the exceptions of social work which requires a 2.50
major GPA and the Honors Guild which requires a 3.40 cumulative GPA. Individual programs may have circumstances unique to the discipline that would
suggest that major or minor GPA requirements might be more appropriately computed in a specific manner; these exceptions are listed within the curriculum
requirements for those majors and minors.
My TU Degree Audit
My TU Degree is the official degree audit system provided to students, faculty, and staff in order to track progress toward graduation. Students are
responsible to regularly review the degree audit to ensure all degree requirements are being met and that the academic plan (e.g., four-year plan) keeps the
student on track for degree completion. Students should review the degree audit with the advisor to determine courses in which to register for upcoming
terms and to create a four-year plan.
Any student meeting a requirement by a course not listed in the audit must submit a course substitution form (approved by the chair of the department requiring the
course); after submission to the Office of the Registrar, the student's My TU Degree audit will be updated to show the course meeting the specific requirement.
Students must contact the Office of the Registrar for clarification of any discrepancies experienced with the catalog, curriculum guides, degree audit, staff, and faculty.
Senior Comprehensive Examination/Paper/Project
A candidate for a baccalaureate degree must successfully complete a comprehensive examination, project, or paper in the major field of study. This requirement
is expected to be completed during the senior year. A student is allowed a maximum of three attempts to pass the comprehensive requirement in any single
major. If a student intends to graduate with more than one major, a comprehensive examination, project, or paper is required for each major. The examinations,
projects, or papers are to be marked superior, pass, or fail. Advisors can discuss available options for a specific major.

Off-Campus/International Studies Programs
Jeff Miller, Director, Off-Campus Programs
One of Taylor University’s objectives is to prepare students for a variety of professions on a foundation of appropriate academic experiences, cultural
breadth, and Christian perspectives. Off-campus study programs challenge values and stimulate critical thinking, whether they take place in the United States
or abroad. Many students return home from their off-campus experience with new perspectives, new questions, and a deeper hunger to learn more about
their own society. In order to keep within its mission, Taylor University offers many opportunities for students to earn undergraduate credit for a semester,
January interterm, or summer in an environment of total academic and cultural immersion.
The following policies apply to off-campus/international studies programs:
 Applicants must have completed one semester in residence on campus prior to applying to any off-campus program, with the exception being
programs specifically designed for a select group of students (e.g., freshmen, transfers).
 A minimum GPA of 2.75 is required for application to off-campus programs. Certain programs may require a higher GPA for participation.
 Students must maintain full-time status (12-17 hours) during off-campus program participation, except in the case where the program is specifically
designed for 18 credit hours.
 Overload hours, independent study courses (offered by Taylor professors), and online distance learning courses are not permitted without prior
approval during off-campus program semesters.
 All off-campus program courses must be taken for a grade—not pass/fail or audit.
 Upper-division and lower-division credit is attributed to the off-campus program course number or course-level standard. In most cases, course
equivalencies are offered at the same level; however, there are exceptions: If a program’s upper-division course is approved to meet a lowerdivision Taylor course, upper-division credit will be awarded; if a program’s lower-division course is approved to meet an upper-division Taylor
course, lower-division credit will be awarded.
 Grades from all approved off-campus programs listed below are considered to be credits through Taylor and will be attributed to the student’s
transcript and factored into the GPA.
 Within two weeks of the start of a semester, each student must provide the Department of Off-Campus Programs with a confirmed schedule
for the semester along with syllabi for all enrolled courses.
Acceptance to off-campus study programs is two-fold and requires: (1) Taylor University approval; and (2) Program approval. In order to participate in any
semester off-campus program, students must obtain approval from their academic advisors and the Offices of Off-Campus Programs, Student Development,
the Bursar, and the Registrar. Students interested in participating in off-campus/international studies programs should consult with the Department of OffCampus Programs.
Since most off-campus programs are independent organizations or universities not operated by Taylor University, students should understand that not every
course will fulfill a Taylor requirement, and due to international registration procedures some students may not receive every class for which they make a
request. Applicability of credits earned while participating in an off-campus program to major, minor, foundational core, or general elective degree
requirements are determined in advance (usually after Taylor University approval and acceptance by the program) in coordination with the appropriate
department(s). Upon their return, students are responsible for any graduation requirements missed during their time off campus.
Billing for off-campus programs is facilitated through the student account of Taylor University based on the formula of: Taylor University tuition (or the
program’s, if higher); an off-campus study program fee; applicable on-campus fees including insurance coverage through CISI; plus the program’s room, board,
and other fees. If not included in whole or in part in the program’s fees, travel to and from the off-campus study program is the responsibility of the student.
Students approved and accepted to off-campus study programs attend several pre-departure orientation sessions in the semester prior to program
participation. Topics covered include on-campus logistics (e.g., registration, housing), health and safety, cultural adjustment, and growing spiritual faith.

Department of Off-Campus Programs (OCP@TAYLOR.EDU) in the Spencer Centre for Global Engagement.
American Studies Program
The American Studies Program (ASP), located in Washington, D.C., is designed for juniors and seniors and is sponsored by the Council for Christian Colleges
and Universities. ASP is an intensive Fall or Spring semester, blending seminars and hands-on internships. Creative internships are individually arranged to
be pre-career work experiences to accommodate diverse majors or areas of interest. The curriculum allows students to choose either the Public Policy
Initiatives Track or Strategic Communication Track. Students may earn 15-16 hours of credit through this interdisciplinary program.
ASP 305 3 hours
Topics in Leadership and Vocation
The Topics in Leadership andVocation course spans the entire semester and is divided into three sections
including 1) Identity and Responsibility, 2) The Centrality of Hope and God’s Kingdom, and 3) Calling and
Career. With respect to identity, personal narratives will be explored to find one’s fullest expression and
deepest sense of true place when we yield to God’s calling (vocation) to embed who we are and what we
do within the larger Biblical narrative. Responsibility will be examined in light of desire to live Biblically
coherent lives. Properly deciphering personal responsibilities requires the hard work of using the Bible
authentically and connecting knowing with doing. The role of narrative as a framework for analysis when
unpacking critical questions will be used. Alternative worldview narratives are also considered in light of the
biblical narrative. In particular, the modern Western culture's claim that we must personalize all normative
concerns will be examined. Responsibilities are viewed as being shaped by the institutional settings (through
roles and responsibilities) that normatively structure the places where we learn, work, play, and worship.
The centrality of Hope and God’s Kingdom is explored as motivations to be intentional actors of hopes is
compared with obstructions or distractions from living Biblically coherent lives. Attention is given to view
of hope as being justified and efforts not made in vain (in the reality of the Kingdom and Holy Spirit) amidst
a fallen world marked by brokenness, disappointment, and suffering.
ASP 321 3 hours
Case Studies in Strategic Communication
Students produce a portfolio comprising group and individual case-study findings,
informational interviews, communications materials, and ethical reflections on strategic
communication practices. The all-track case study investigates the role strategic
communication—coordinating and measuring the impact of advertising, direct response,
fundraising and development, marketing, and public relations—plays in achieving
organizational goals. Direct engagement with Washington, D.C. organizations and
communication professionals helps students learn from experience how to differentiate
between the practices of strategic, tactical, operational, and contingency plans. Each student
produces a case study tied to his or her internship or another national or international
organization. A concluding conference allows students to share and compare research
findings across institutional types and sizes.

field. Meetings are structured, in part, around discussions a Supplemental Mentorship
Text. The professional mentor selects the text, which is typically a novel or (auto)
biography. The book serves as a basis of inquiry and insight into the challenges of weaving
together our understandings of calling and career. Students submit a Mentorship Write-Up
after each meeting, which includes notes from and reflections on the meeting. The first
meeting between mentor and student is organized by ASP, scheduled to take place within
the first three weeks of the semester. Mentors will schedule all additional meetings.

Public Policy Initiatives Track
ASP 315 3 hours
Public Policy Analysis Field Seminar
This seminar provides a detailed survey of the public policy issue of international
migration. International migration refers to the movement-both emigration and
immigration-of people across international borders. International migration patterns
always carry important political implications for both the sending and receiving
countries. Its study provides opportunity for learners to address critical questions
pertaining to contemporary citizenship, democratic practice, equality, freedom,
globalization, and liberalism. In this course, ASP faculty equips students through course
lectures with the conceptual and analytical tools required to design a research agenda
for a Washington, D.C. audience. Area experts and practitioners deliver professional
briefings to introduce the myriad institutions and policy positions that animate three
key public debates on migration-economics/social welfare, security, and national
identity. Early in the course, students choose a salient topic within the issue area. The
research proposal-the course's final project-presents a literature review on the
migration topic, a preliminary assessment of how competing public arguments on the
selected topic resonate you're your own (bourgeoning) understanding of what biblical
justice requires in this matter, and a strategy for engaging leading institutions and
individuals in Washington, D.C. through future field work.
ASP 325 3 hours
Advocacy and Diplomacy Field Seminar
The Public Policy Research Project supports the student-researcher to complete
individual research projects from the Applied Politics and Public Policy Seminar and
fashion empirical findings into an effective advocacy agenda. The advocacy component
is designed as a group project. Students organize into a small research team tasked
with the responsibility of providing policy recommendations that address three key
areas of debate on immigration-economic/social welfare, security, and national
identity. Research teams conduct personal interviews from among leading institutions
and individuals in Washington, D.C., as well as attend area briefings, conferences,
hearings, and other events related to the policy issue. Support of their domestic
policy recommendations must include international sources. The final project
requires each group to present an executive summary of their findings and
recommendations in a mock Congressional briefing held in a Congressional office
building. The executive summary should exhibit a mature policy analysis and advocate
a position that connects its findings with the authors' shared understanding of the
biblical themes of shalom and justice in public (i.e., non-sectarian) language.

Irish Literature
This course concentrates upon literature written by Irish writers within Irish contexts
and landscapes—intellectual and emotional when not physical. Assignments exploit
unique opportunities available while studying in Ireland itself, adjacent to England.
More complicated is the colonial influence upon Ireland, the island’s currently divided
space, “the troubles,” and the connection between high art and popular expression.
Thus, a focus of the course will be how the search for a literary voice not only parallels,

 Student must work with the two advisors referenced above and utilize the rationale to develop an academically challenging curriculum of
required courses to be included in the Individual Goal-Oriented major.
 Student must create a complete four-year plan addressing all degree requirements, including this major.
 Student must obtain letters of support from both faculty advisors.
 Student must complete the “Request for Goal-Oriented Major” form available from the Office of the Registrar.

The purpose of the Biblical Studies, Christian Ministries, and Philosophy Department is to provide students with a solid understanding of the foundation of
the Christian faith to enhance any vocation; to prepare for church, para-church, or cross-cultural ministry; or to prepare for graduate study. This preparation
is two-fold: First, the department provides a significant portion of the “faith” side of the integration of faith and learning by teaching four foundational core
courses required of the entire student body. These four courses (BIB 110 and 210, REL 313, and PHI 413) are sequenced with each successive course
serving as the prerequisite for the next. As a whole, these foundational core courses are designed to equip students with enough theological and philosophical
substance to be able to integrate biblical truth within their respective disciplines as well as think and live “Christianly” in our post-modern world. A.W.
Tozer said, “The history of mankind will probably show that no people has ever risen above its religion, and man’s spiritual history will positively demonstrate that no
religion has ever been greater than its idea of God.” Thus, the ultimate goal of the foundational core courses taught within this department is that the student
know and love God with all his or her heart and mind (John 17:31; Luke 10:27) and become more Christ-like in thought, speech, and action (Romans 8:29).
Second, the department offers four majors—Biblical Literature, Christian Ministries, Philosophy, and Youth Ministry—to prepare students who will
demonstrate competence in biblical, educational, and philosophical truth in preparation for graduate studies and lifelong servant/leadership roles in
professional Christian ministries. In addition, eight minors are offered in Biblical Languages, Biblical Literature, Christian Ministries, Philosophy, Intercultural
Studies/Missions, Applied Missions, Youth Ministry, and Ethics. These majors and minors are designed to complement other majors, and consequently,
students are encouraged to consider adding a second major or a minor from the BSCP department to enhance their primary program of study.
Many students within the department choose to take advantage of Taylor’s affiliation with Jerusalem University College (JUC) and spend a semester studying
in Jerusalem. Men and women anticipating seminary study should also select other electives in their undergraduate course of study that encompass the
world of ideas, nature and human affairs. Other overseas academic trips are offered in January for Foundational Core credit. They include Israel (BIB 110
or 210 equivalencies) and Greece and Italy (BIB 210 equivalency).
Biblical Studies
The Biblical Studies program is designed for students who desire a robust intellectual understanding of the foundation of the Christian faith. In the process
of the program, students study biblical texts and explore various approaches to understanding them. Majors and minors in Biblical Literature develop
proficiency as informed and observant interpreters of biblical passages as they learn to draw upon theological, historical, linguistic, and literary insights for
richer, more complete understandings of texts. Students also grow in their ability to think about, write about, discuss, and apply biblical teachings.
Students who take the Biblical Literature major anticipating graduate study and professional ministry should also take an introductory course in philosophy
and logic and be able to read at least one theologically significant foreign language. The primary language is Greek, although Hebrew is also recommended.
Students who plan to pursue seminary study should seek the counsel of the department faculty and consult with representatives from their church or
ministry network to determine which graduate school(s) would best prepare them for their anticipated career. Early in their senior year, students should
correspond with the school(s) to which they intend to apply.
Biblical Literature (BA)
The Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in Biblical Literature includes 33 hours; two years of sequential study in one foreign language; and the writing,

advisors or the pre-law advisor about the best time to take pre-law courses.

Environmental Science, Public Health, and Sustainable Development
Chair, Professor M. Guebert
Public Health Program Director, Professor R. Aronson
Assistant Professors S. Bielko, P. Grabowski, R. Reber
The Department of Environmental Science, Public Health and Sustainable Development (EPS) provides students with practical scientific knowledge and ethical
grounding for stewardship of the environment and human communities, as well as professional skills to effectively minister to a world in need. We capture
this approach as “science for stewardship and service,” which includes a deeper understanding of the Christian foundation beneath a faith-based pursuit of
knowledge and application in our courses. This approach, both inside and outside the classroom, is fundamental to our offering of Foundational Core
courses for students completing other majors in the liberal arts as well as to students majoring in our department. To this end, we offer majors in
Environmental Science, Public Health, and Sustainable Development; one integrated major in Chemistry—Environmental Science; and two minors, all of
which involve a deep concern for God’s human and non-human creation.
Environmental Science
In this major, in existence since 1982, students gain knowledge in natural sciences, principles of environmental ethics, law, and stewardship, and practical
skills in problem-solving. With concentrations in Biology and Geology, students may focus on deep conceptual knowledge in the natural sciences which
prepares them for a variety of careers in government agencies, private consulting, non-profit organizations, and environmental education.
A mid-level, field-intensive course, Field Natural History of the Black Hills (in South Dakota) is required usually in Sophomore summer and is a favorite
among students. To build professional skills and experience, a practicum is required, usually in the summer following the Sophomore or Junior year. Facultymentored student research is encouraged to build capacity for graduate school. As a result of this powerful combination of relevant theory and field
experience, nearly 100% of our graduates find placement in either graduate programs or the workplace.
Environmental Science (BS)
The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Environmental Science requires 77 hours. Students may not double major with Sustainable Development. All major
courses, including those in the concentration, must be completed with a grade of C- or better and are included in the major GPA.

Public Health
The Public Health majors, established in 2013, reflect the broad and interdisciplinary nature of the profession, and prepare students to serve effectively to a
world in need. While uncommon at the undergraduate level, there is a growing national appreciation for the value of teaching public health in liberal arts
institutions, where students can be challenged to consider physical, social, economic, cultural and biologic factors that impact the health of populations.
These majors offer a strong set of core courses along with great flexibility to focus elective courses in specific sub-areas of public health. Coursework is
designed to be relevant, participatory, experiential, and grounded in a Biblical worldview with a commitment to joining in Christ’s redemptive work for all
of creation. Students complete a practicum experience that engages them with ongoing public health and community health development work in either the
U.S. or abroad in communities experiencing public health problems. Innovative dual majors are encouraged.
Students will be prepared to compete for entrance into graduate programs in public health and related fields, and to effectively work in partnership with
communities to address those conditions that produce poor health in populations. We offer both a BS and a BA, as well as a minor.
Public Health (BA)
The Bachelor of Arts degree with a major in Public Health requires two years of one foreign language and 53-55 hours in the major. All major courses must

Sustainable Development
Sustainable Development, established in 2015, provides interdisciplinary training for solving global sustainability problems in U.S. and international settings.
Students build a broad foundational understanding of the interactions of the three spheres of sustainability—environment, economics, and society. By
studying at the nexus of these subjects, students develop a holistic understanding of key issues facing humanity and the environment.
In this program, students take core courses in sustainability, environmental science, sociology, public health, and economics and gain depth in a specific area
by choosing elective courses that connect their passion for studies with their desire to help people. An international, field-based course during January
interterm enables students to experience and apply what they have been learning. Near the end of the curriculum each student participates in a field-based
development project through a required practicum and a senior capstone experience involving a group research project on a local, real-world issue.

Health Sciences
Health Science
Erik Hayes and Bob Aronson, Advisors
While preparation for graduate work in medicine or allied health fields can be done through any major available at Taylor, if necessary preparatory courses
are taken, majors in these areas offer concentrations designed specifically for this purpose. The Health Science major includes a dual degree program leading
to an undergraduate degree in Nursing.
A major in Health Science is offered with either a concentration in Pre-Nursing or Pre-Nursing and Public Health. Upon successful completion of three
years at Taylor University, students then complete an approved Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) program at an approved accredited school. Upon
receipt of an official transcript verifying the satisfactory completion of the BSN program, the student is awarded a baccalaureate degree by Taylor University.
Careful planning should allow opportunity for study in affiliated programs, including health science and public health courses in Ecuador or Uganda.
All Taylor University degree requirements are applicable with the following exception: 22 of the final 30 credit hours completed through Taylor. Normally,
students complete all applicable requirements within three years, including a total of 101 credits from a minimum of 43 major hours, foundational core
curriculum, and general electives. A minimum of 64 earned credit hours must be through Taylor.
Taylor University currently maintains a preferred admissions agreement with Indiana Wesleyan University’s 14 month accelerated nursing program, but
cannot guarantee acceptance into this BSN program for any individual student.
Health Science (BS)
The Bachelor of Science degree with a major in Health Science requires 42-65 hours including a concentration in Pre-Nursing or Pre-Nursing and Public
Health in addition to the successful completion of an approved BSN program from an accredited school. Taylor University cannot guarantee acceptance
into a BSN program. All major courses, including those in the concentration, must be completed with a grade of C- or better and are included in the major GPA; only
courses taken through Taylor count toward the major and cumulative GPA.

Human Physiology and Preventive Medicine
Erik Hayes and Brian Dewar, Advisors
Human Physiology and Preventive Medicine is designed specifically for students seeking to enter into professional schools related to health care (e.g., medical
school, physician assistant, physical therapist, occupational therapist, nursing). It first explores a basic foundation of human anatomy, physiology, cellular
biology, and chemistry followed by more in depth physiology courses related specifically to physiological systems, the pathophysiology of chronic disease of
those systems, and the scientific evidence and mechanism for prevention of disease through lifestyle modification. Students will gain a basic background in
human nutrition, health psychology, and public health preparing them for work as health educators in our local medical clinic working to help members of the
community prevent and treat chronic disease. The major is intentionally small enough to allow students space to meet all the prerequisite requirements for
professional school entrance exams and professional school admission requirements. In addition, students will have room to pursue semester abroad
experiences, faculty mentored research, and clinical internships.
Students wishing to follow more traditional paths to professional schools in medicine and health care (e.g., biology or chemistry) or choosing majors that
would not typically be associated directly with health care but are nonetheless related to human health and flourishing (e.g., social work, music therapy,
missions) may choose to complete a minor in Preventive Medicine.

Kinesiology
Chair, Professor M. Renfrow
Professors D. Anderson, E. Hayes
Associate Professor J. Marsee
Assistant Professor B. Dykstra, B. Kendall, A. Stucky
The Kinesiology Department has two major purposes: (1) to prepare competent, caring, and reflective Christian leaders for world service in exercise science,
sport management, and coaching; and (2) to help students acquire the skills and attitudes for lifetime wellness, as well as wholesome and active use of their
leisure time.
Baccalaureate degrees are offered in Exercise Science and Sport Management as well as a Sport Management minor. A Coaching minor is offered through
the department for students who are interested in studying sport and coaching. Candidates for the Bachelor of Arts degree must complete two years of a
foreign language.
The three credits required in the foundational core curriculum must be met by taking KIN 100 plus KIN 200 or one of the following to substitute for KIN
200: KIN 250, 300, 302, 333, 334, or EXS 280. Elementary Education majors must take KIN 250. Exercise Science majors complete this requirement by
taking EXS 111, 316, and 318. Pre-Med, Public Health, and allied health students who are not Exercise Science majors are recommended to take KIN 221
for the three credits required for the foundational core curriculum.
One aspect of our work as professors at a Christian liberal arts university is to build relationships with our students that we might participate in God’s work
of preparing them for a well-lived and meaningful life. The Kinesiology Department aims to fulfill this educational calling through a whole-person focused
curriculum. The Fitness for Life course will provide specific instruction in the more technical aspects of caring for the human body as part of the created
order including rest/shalom, nutrition, and activity. As such, this course will serve as the foundation for an understanding of basic principles of a well-lived
embodied life. The connections between mind, body, and spirit will be explored knowing that we are living, breathing, touchable souls made by a mysterious
union of the sacred dust of God and the sacred breath of God.
Exercise Science
The mission of the Taylor University Exercise Science program is to foster courage, wisdom, and joy in leaders who are well-prepared for a lifetime of
service to improve the health of society.

Science Research Training Program
The purpose of the Science Research Training Program is to stimulate students beyond “normal education” with hands-on practical experiences, promote
real-world industrial relationships (careers), and prepare future graduate students. As faculty, students and staff, our goal is to pursue excellence (world
leadership in selected research areas) and thereby stay on the cutting edge of scientific research and thought.
We encourage scholarly research and crossover interactions between various disciplines, and we promote publications in professional journals by Taylor
University faculty and students. Where possible, we relate science with society and apply science and technology to various mission field needs. Research
activities are carried on quietly and often on a long-range basis, but are essential to leadership and progress. During the summer months, when faculty and
students can devote more time to independent research, student stipends are available for research one-on-one with a faculty member. These projects
include the areas of biology, chemistry, computer science, engineering, environmental science, mathematics, and physics.

In support of the University’s mission, the Taylor University Business Department prepares students to engage in a life of servant leadership characterized
by lifelong learning, innovation, excellence, and ethics in organizations around the world.
As an expression of Taylor’s multi-dimensional education philosophy, the department offers majors in Accounting, Finance, Management, and Marketing.
Minors are available in Accounting, Economics, Entrepreneurship, Finance, Management, and Marketing.
All business curriculum courses combine theory, principles, techniques, and practical applications to enhance graduates’ employment opportunities and serve
as a solid groundwork for graduate studies. The relevance of Christian faith through current, real-world situations is emphasized in classes, field trips, and
expert Christian guest lecturers. Team development and business projects are available in selected business courses; a practicum experience is required of
all business school students. Development of communication skills, both written and oral, is emphasized. Many classes give attention to problem solving
and quantitative analysis.
In the summer following a student’s junior year, a practicum/internship for four credit hours is required of all majors.
Graduation requirements in the majors include passing all courses within the major with grades of C- or better. Any major course with a grade below Cmust be repeated before subsequent sequential courses may be taken. All major courses (including electives) must be passed with a grade of C- or better.
Seniors must pass a senior comprehensive examination in their major.
The Business Department is accredited by the Accreditation Council for Business Schools and Programs (ACBSP).

Director of Teacher Certification Kim Overbey
Taylor University seeks to develop competent, caring, and reflective teachers prepared for world service. The belief that teachers who have experienced a
vigorous professional preparation within the framework of evangelical Christian values will have a profound influence on the students they teach in public,
private, or overseas schools pervades the education program approach. A comprehensive liberal arts curriculum provides the foundation for subject matter
competence as well as lifelong learning, leadership, and continued growth in the teaching profession. The Education Department cooperates with other
departments to ensure the development of high quality foundational core and major fields of study. Taylor University’s teacher education program is
accredited by NCATE (National Council for Accreditation of Teacher Education) and the Indiana Department of Education. Admission to, retention in, and
completion of an approved teacher education program at Taylor University is coordinated by the Director of Teacher Education.
Students seeking teaching certification may fulfill the curriculum requirements in education while earning either a Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science
degree. The Bachelor of Arts degree requires the completion of two years of one foreign language.
Students wishing to explore or prepare for the teaching profession should become involved in the teacher education program as early as possible in their
college careers. It is advised that initial steps be taken as an entering freshman or as soon as possible after entering Taylor. Upon declaring a major area of
study (elementary or a secondary area), the student is assigned an academic advisor. This academic advisor continues to advise the student throughout the
entire program. However, by use of the curriculum guide for the chosen area of study, much of the student’s planning may be self-directed. Curriculum
guides containing course requirements for all teacher education programs offered at Taylor may be obtained from the Department of Education. The
Teacher Education Program Student Handbook includes a 4-year program timeline and course sequence for foundational core, major, and professional
education courses that assist the students in planning their teacher education programs.
The Indiana Department of Education has approved new teacher licensure rules: Rules for Educator Preparation and Accountability. Interpretation of the
new licensure rules by the Indiana Department of Education is modified from time to time. Candidates must follow the most current curriculum guides and
licensing tests as required by the Indiana Department of Education. The most current program information and licensure requirements can be obtained in
the Education Department Office in Euler 020 and from the Director of Teacher Certification in Euler 003.
Admission to the Teacher Education Program: Step One
There is a formal admission procedure to the teacher education program. A student is admitted to the program upon completion of an official application
form (initiated through the office of the Director of Teacher Certification) and favorable action by the Teacher Education Committee. The application
should be completed during the first term of a student’s sophomore year. Students are formally admitted to the teacher education program after completing
three terms of college work, one of which must have been at Taylor. The Teacher Education Committee has established standards that students must meet
in order to be admitted to and remain in the program. Factors encompassed by these standards are scholastic performance, communication skills, portfolio
requirements, state qualifying scores for the CASA exam or state qualifying composite SAT or ACT scores, and departmental recommendation. Detailed
explanations of these standards may be obtained from the department.
Admission to Supervised Internship (Student Teaching): Step Two
Subsequent to admission to the program, there is a formal admission procedure to student teaching. The application is initiated and facilitated through the
Office of the Director of Student Teaching and should be prepared and ready for consideration (by the Teacher Education Committee) by the first semester
of the junior year. The factors considered by the Teacher Education Committee include: (1) successful completion of prerequisite courses; (2) departmental
recommendation; (3) portfolio requirements; and (4) scholastic performance. Detailed explanations of these standards may be obtained from the department.
Scholastic Performance
Teacher education program standards include students passing ENG 110, CAS 110, all professional education, and all major courses with grades of C- or better. Also,
a grade of C- or better in education courses must be achieved as a condition for taking sequential courses for which the course is a prerequisite and for graduation.
Transfer of Credit from Other Institutions
Students seeking admission to the Taylor teacher education program through transfer from another institution must meet the standards required of regularly
enrolled students. Credits are assessed by the Registrar. The Director of Teacher Certification, after consultation with the appropriate department chair,
will accept transfer credit when the courses taken are equivalent to requirements on a designated major curriculum guide.
Field Experiences and Student Teaching
Field experiences with children and youth, with strong emphasis on multicultural education, are considered a vital part of teacher preparation. Beginning
with the first professional education course and continuing through the senior year, such experiences are required for each prospective teacher. The
culmination of these professional experiences occurs during the senior year with full-time student teaching. During this final experience, a student is expected
to assume as much as possible the total responsibilities of a teacher. Student teaching is a 16-week fall or Spring semester activity.
Opportunities are provided for overseas student teaching. After completing a 10-week experience stateside, students may teach for six or more weeks in an overseas
setting. Application for overseas student teaching must be submitted during the Fall semester of the junior year. Applications are available in the department.
Junior Methods Practicum (JuMP)
All elementary education candidates will take the junior block field experience during both fall and spring of the junior year. Students will be placed in an all
day field experience on Tuesday and Thursday.
Comprehensive Exam Requirement
All Elementary Education majors are required to take the Elementary Pedagogy (CORE) and score 220 or above. Any elementary education major who
does not successfully pass is provided opportunity to participate in a tutorial-guided instruction program under the direction of the Academic Enrichment
Center or Department of Education to prepare for retaking the test or a departmental exam. In secondary education, the comprehensive examination is in
the major teaching field. A student is allowed a maximum of three attempts to pass the comprehensive examination in any single major.
Practicum
Opportunities for practicum experiences in rural, urban, and overseas settings are available. A practicum is supervised learning involving a firsthand field
experience or project. It is offered primarily during January interterm or summer with the consent of a supervising professor and the approval of the
department chair. Under certain conditions a practicum may be required to demonstrate readiness for student teaching. In order to receive a grade, the
experience or project must be supervised.
Fields of Study
Curricula that meet the licensing standards of the Indiana Department of Education are listed on the curriculum guides available to each student. Preparation
for initial teaching Indiana licenses in the following fields is provided at Taylor.
191
Certification
All teacher education programs have been designed to meet Indiana certification requirements and have been approved by the Indiana Department of
Education. Students who meet graduation requirements, complete an approved teacher education program, successfully complete student teaching, and
meet the Indiana qualifying scores on the required CORE and Pedagogy tests will be eligible for Indiana certification (a teaching license). The teacher
certification office is responsible for verifying to the Indiana Department of Education that all requirements for certification have been met and for processing
all applications for certification.
Indiana has an Interstate Agreement Contract with many states (reciprocity). However, additional requirements may need to be met in order to receive
permanent certification in these states. Students who plan to teach outside of Indiana should obtain a current description of certification requirements from
each state where they plan to teach, because requirements often change from year to year. Addresses and telephone numbers for every State Department
of Education are available online.

English Language Teaching
Chair, TESOL Program Coordinator, Instructor K. Regier
Associate Professor C. Brainer
Instructor R. Kantaruk
The English Language Teaching department consists of two areas: TESOL Program, providing professional preparation for students intending to teach English
to speakers of other languages, and Institute for English Language Studies, offering language learning opportunities to non-native speakers of English.
IELS Program
Through its Institute for English Language Studies (IELS), Taylor University offers a variety of programs to non-native English speakers who wish to improve
their English proficiency either for entrance to an English-based academic program or for general proficiency.
Students who are planning to study at the associate, baccalaureate, or graduate level in English can enroll in the academic English program which is comprised
of one or two semesters depending on the entry level of proficiency and rate of progress. This program provides gradual transitions to regular college
classes through coursework in the “American Classroom,” as well as through structured class observations to better understand faculty-student interaction
in the Western context.
For students who wish to earn a certificate in Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL), the Institute provides a joint curriculum with the
TESOL program. Students who have completed the ESL program at a level sufficient for matriculation into the university’s degree programs can obtain the
TESOL certificate in one year of additional study. This option provides the credential often required to teach English in their home countries.
TESOL Program
The TESOL (Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages) Program at Taylor University offers three teacher training programs which prepare students
to work both domestically with immigrants, and internationally with people learning English for international communication.
Teaching English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL) Minor
Open to all majors, except those majors leading to education licensure, the TESOL minor requires 24-26 hours and provides training to those interested in
teaching English in international or non-public education contexts. The minor also provides cross-cultural and pedagogical training. All minor courses must be
completed with a grade of C- or better and are included in the minor GPA.

Orphans and Vulnerable Children
Scott Moeschberger, Director
The Orphans and Vulnerable Children major is an innovative “problem-focused major” where students can start with the challenges of a global orphan crisis
and take courses designed to equip them to intervene in meaningful ways. It is designed to pair easily with a complementary discipline. By design, this
interdisciplinary major includes elements of developmental psychology, global health, principles of community development, working with families,
assessment, and skills in philanthropy. This major will prepare students to enter into the challenges presented by a world with millions of at-risk children
and communities. Students will gain an understanding of issues that range from the development of the individual (including exposure to trauma and violence),
to global health and policy issues, to assessing intervention efforts at all levels. Service-learning through practicums and research provide opportunities to
apply learning in a hands-on environment and create opportunities for students to contribute to the field as emerging scholars.

Sociology
Chair, Professor M. Jessup
Professors S. Bird, R. Priest
Sociology and anthropology offer important and distinct ways of seeing the world that enhances the skills of the intellect. Sociology and anthropology help
students be aware of the impact of social experiences, conditions, and opportunities by incorporating a consciousness of history, the significance of culture,
and the impact of the social structure or institutions on social life. Sociology enables students to acknowledge the social forces and factors affecting their
own private lives and enhances a better understanding of complex social and cultural issues. Anthropology helps students understand the complexity of
cultures across all of human history and draws and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as the humanities and physical
sciences. A central concern of anthropologists is the application of knowledge to the solution of human problems. Sociology and anthropology encourage
efforts to minister the redemptive love of Christ by recognizing the complexities of international, national, and local issues and situations, and recognize how
culture and the social structure affect the way people live and understand the gospel. Moreover, sociology and anthropology encourage students to engage
in action that promotes global responsibility, fosters healing, and restores human dignity.
Based on national trends, a combined anthropology and sociology major is excellent preparation for future graduate work in anthropology or sociology in
order to become a professor, researcher, or applied anthropologist/sociologist. The undergraduate degree provides a strong liberal arts preparation for
entry-level positions, including business, social/human services, archaeology, cultural resource management, historic preservation, community development,
human rights/social justice advocacy, tourism/heritage, missions/missiology, non-profits/NGOs, and government/public service careers. Moreover, many
students choose anthropology and sociology because they see it as a broad liberal arts base for professions such as law, education, medicine, social work,
counseling, and missiology/missions.

Athletics
The University recognizes and accepts the educational, social, and promotional impact the athletic program has on the institution and its constituency.
Athletics is an integral part of the “whole person” education at Taylor University. The athletic program complements the institution in its mission “to
develop servant leaders marked with a passion to minister Christ’s redemptive love and truth to a world in need.”
The total development of the student athlete is paramount in the organization and implementation of the athletic program. Participation in intercollegiate
athletics provides an arena whereby the student athlete may be developed, tested, and encouraged to achieve maximum physical, emotional, intellectual, and
spiritual potential. The goal, through competition, is to assist and support student athletes in their understanding of a Christian response to a fundamental
human experience.
The Taylor University philosophy of athletics is framed within the following understandings:
1. The athletic department is staffed by those who articulate and evidence a life committed to Jesus Christ. Further, they regard their profession, whether
in or out of the classroom, as an opportunity to educate, mentor, and model the core values of what it means to be a man or woman of God.
Commitment to Jesus Christ signifies a lifestyle and coaching style that calls for a standard of competitive excellence (Col. 3:23). It is intended that all
coaches hold faculty rank and that all coaches function as educators.
2. Taylor University has a rich heritage of utilizing athletics as a means of Christian outreach and service. It is our intent to reaffirm, build upon, and
create opportunities for Christian witness and discipleship through a successful intercollegiate athletic program.
3. The intellectual, spiritual, emotional, physical, and social well-being and development of our student athletes is paramount in our dealings with student
athletes. Athletic participation is a platform not only for complementing our liberal arts and foundational core programs, but also for assuring that the
core values (Biblically Anchored, Christ Centered, Faith Learning Integrated, Liberal Arts Grounded, World Engaging, Whole Person Focused, and
Servant Leader Motivated) of the University are being developed.
4. A successful intercollegiate athletic program creates a strong sense of community spirit. Athletics significantly contributes to a positive campus ethos
and to constituent goodwill. The University as a whole benefits by giving visibility to both the athletic programs and to the athletes involved in these
programs. We endeavor to make our programs an enduring source of pride for the university, participants, alumni, and the greater Taylor community.
5. The development of student leadership has long been a hallmark of Taylor University objectives and Student Development. The dynamics of
intercollegiate competition, coupled with mentoring by Christian coaches, represents the potential for a rich environment of leadership development
that is personalized and tested.

Intercollegiate sports for men include baseball, basketball, cross-country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and track and field; women compete in

We know the sacrifices made by each family are significant in obtaining a Taylor University education. We would like you to know that the charges billed
cover approximately 90% of our costs for delivering a Taylor education. Alumni, friends, parents, and others provide the remaining 10% of our costs through
gifts and other sources of revenue. We thank God for you and for the support of others as we prepare students to minister the redemptive love and truth
of Christ to a world in need.
The University reserves the right to increase rates if and when necessary.
Annual Costs
Refer to the Taylor University Tuition and Fee Schedule for the current costs for an academic year. This publication is available from the Office of the
Bursar/Student Accounts.
Other Charges
Certain classes may require the student to purchase materials for specific projects or may require a basic materials charge. These costs vary by course and
are charged equally to each student enrolled in the course. Certain other charges are assessed for courses requiring private or special instruction and for
administrative costs for special services and transportation.
Advance Payment
All returning students are required to pay an advance payment of $100 to secure their registration for the fall semester. Advance payment is due by June 1.
Refund of the $100 advance payment to returning students is granted as follows:
Cancellation Date Refund
Through June 30 100%
July 1-14 75%
July 15 and After 0%
Advanced Placement (AP) Credit
A $20 posting fee is assessed for each hour of AP credit awarded and posted to the Taylor transcript.
College Level Examination Program (CLEP)
An examination fee of $85 is charged for each test administered, plus a $15 administration fee. A $20 additional fee exists for each hour of CLEP college
credit awarded and posted to the Taylor transcript.
Change of Registration
A refund of charges will be given to students dropping from full-time to part-time status, or lowering their part-time hours, by the last date to drop a class
without a transcript entry (“drop/add” period) for the fall and spring semesters. There is no reduction to the tuition charge for dropped hours after this
drop/add period. Course fees are refundable only during the drop/add period. Off-campus program tuition and fees are refundable only in accordance with
each program’s specific refund policy.
Emergency Funds
The Taylor Parents Association raises financial resources each year to be allocated for student emergencies. Medical costs not covered by insurance and
emergency travel in case of death or severe sickness of immediate family are two of the most frequent reasons for allocations of this fund. Other emergency
costs may be considered. Contact the Vice President for Student Development for more information.
216
Payment of Bills
The billing statement access information is emailed on or by the last day of each month to the student’s TU email address, with payment due the 20th of the
month. The initial billing statement for the fall semester is available in late July and is due in full by August 20 unless enrolled in a payment plan.
The January interterm and spring billing statement is available in late December and is due in full by January 20 unless enrolled in a payment plan. Historically,
January interterm charges have been billed with spring semester.
Statements are issued each month for students who owe a balance or have had transactions to their account during that billing cycle. Any new charges that
may occur are due the 20th of the month in which they are billed. Full account information is available through the portal and includes unbilled activity as
well as statements. Payment can be submitted online through this secure site. There is no fee to pay with electronic check. Payment by credit card
(American Express, Discover, MasterCard, or VISA) will incur a convenience fee. It is the student’s responsibility to provide access to their account
information to their parents, and the student may do so by authorizing their parent on the billing site.
Taylor University uses the @TAYLOR.EDU student email address to communicate, and students are responsible to check their Taylor email account regularly
as they miss important information if they do not do so. Students can set up their preferred address for online billing and also authorize additional (e.g.,
parent) e-billing addresses by completing the authorization that can be accessed through their online account.
There are two payment options available:
 Payment in full by the due date of August 20 for fall semester and January 20 for spring semester. Payment for incremental additional charges that
may occur are due by the 20th of the month for which charges are billed.
 Enroll in a Taylor University monthly payment plan to split the semester payment into equal monthly payments. The only cost to enroll is $30 per
semester and several options are available ranging from 6 to 2 payments per semester. Enrollment is at the online student account site.
Taylor charges a monthly penalty on late payments based on the following policy: Any account balance not paid by the due date when first billed, or deferred
pursuant to one of the payment options described above, will be subject to a monthly late fee equal to the greater of $5 or interest accrued at 1.08% (annual
percentage rate of 13 percent).
A student’s account must be current to avoid a Bursar hold on registration, and a student’s account must be paid in full for release of transcripts or diploma.
Additional information may be found in the Tuition and Fees Schedule available in the Office of the Bursar/Student Accounts.
Refund Schedule (Fall and Spring Semesters)
This refund schedule applies only to students with full withdrawal from the University. Students who withdraw from a course or courses but remain enrolled
at the University do not receive any adjustment to their charges. Drops/Adds prior to the end of the first week of a semester (resulting in no transcript
entry) could result in tuition changes.

Mandatory student fees and course fees are nonrefundable. No refund of tuition will be given for complete withdrawal after the end of the sixth week.
Refund of charges are based on the total term bill and on the date the official withdrawal form is completed. The matriculation and housing deposits are

of the Bursar, School Dean, and Vice President for Student Development.
If a student is receiving financial aid, funds will be returned to the aid source(s) according to the Taylor University Return of Financial Aid Funds policy.
217
Financial Aid
The following information regarding financial aid is accurate at the time of the catalog printing, but is subject to change due to changing federal and state
regulations and institutional policies and budgetary constraints. For the most current information, please refer to the financial aid section of our website at
https://public.taylor.edu/admissions/undergraduate/tuition-financial-aid/ or contact the Financial Aid Office.
The financial aid programs at Taylor recognize that it is the basic responsibility of students and their families to finance a college education. However, the
rising cost of education has made it necessary for many students to enlist financial assistance outside their personal resources. Financial aid can help many
qualified students attend Taylor regardless of financial circumstances.
The financial aid programs offer assistance to students in need in the form of scholarships, grants, loans, and employment. Financial aid is awarded primarily
on the basis of financial need, except in the case of merit scholarships that require superior academic achievement and ability. If the student’s aid package is
based on financial need, the total aid package (including merit and outside scholarships) cannot exceed the student’s financial need.
Financial need is defined as the difference between a family’s resources and the total cost of attending college. If a difference exists between the total cost
of attending Taylor (including all tuition, fees, room, board, books, supplies, and personal expenses) and the ability of the family to meet these educational
costs, the student is determined to have financial need. An evaluation of financial need includes consideration of the parents’ and student’s income and
assets, household size, and number of household members in college.
To determine the extent of the student’s financial need and the family’s ability to pay for educational expenses, Taylor uses the Free Application for Federal
Student Aid (FAFSA). An analysis of this data determines the student’s eligibility for need-based grants, loans, and work study.
Students enrolled in Taylor University’s established off-campus programs will receive financial aid as though they were on campus. Students may only receive
institutional financial aid for their first off-campus program. Federal financial aid is available for additional study abroad programs. No financial aid (federal
or institutional) will be awarded to students attending off-campus programs not offered through Taylor University.
Students who plan to enroll on a part-time basis should consult the director of financial aid about the availability of financial aid programs. It should be noted
that many aid programs require that a student be enrolled full time (a minimum of 12 credit hours per semester).
To continue to receive need-based financial aid, a student cannot be on extended academic probation and must meet the criteria established in the Taylor
University Satisfactory Academic Progress Policy. Visit https://public.taylor.edu/admissions/undergraduate/tuition-financial-aid/forms-and-documents.shtml
for a copy of this policy online. Satisfactory academic progress for financial aid applicants/recipients shall be measured both qualitatively and quantitatively.
In order to maintain eligibility to receive financial aid, a student must successfully complete at least 50% of the credit hours attempted in a given term and
80% of the overall credit hours attempted. The student must also complete his/her undergraduate degree within 160 credit hours attempted, including
transfer hours, AP and CLEP credit, and any other credits listed on the academic transcript.
How to Apply for Financial Aid
Students should begin the application process for financial aid as soon as possible after October 1. Those only interested in merit-based programs need not
submit any financial aid forms. The Financial Aid Office automatically awards merit-based scholarships after receiving the student’s SAT/ACT scores and
high school GPA information from the Admissions Office.
In order to receive timely consideration in the awarding of financial aid, students must: (1) submit the indicated forms; (2) respond
promptly to requests for additional information, documentation, etc.; and (3) comply with the following directives:
 Be accepted for admission to Taylor University. Students may apply for financial aid prior to their acceptance at Taylor, but financial aid will not be
awarded until acceptance is finalized. Please note that transfer students must indicate Taylor University as a recipient of their Free Application for
Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) information and have their financial aid forms received by the federal processor by April 15.
 Complete the FAFSA online at https://fafsa.ed.gov as soon as possible after October 1. The federal processor must receive the FAFSA by April 15, in
order to be considered for need-based institutional aid. Students whose forms are received after this date will only be eligible for the Federal Stafford
Loan, Federal Pell Grant, Federal PLUS funds, and non-need merit-based aid. Please also consider the following:
1. The release of information to Taylor University should be clearly requested on the FAFSA (code # 001838).
2. Additional forms may be required in order to receive state aid from Vermont or Rhode Island. Students should check with their high school
guidance officer regarding which forms are required by their state.
3. In order for Indiana residents to be considered for state aid, the FAFSA must be received by April 15. No other form is required.
218
Merit-Based Awards
Merit-based awards are presented to students who demonstrate outstanding scholarship. Financial need is not considered for this type of aid. The President
Scholarship, Dean Scholarship, Faculty Scholarship, Trustee Scholarship, Academic Merit Award, and Class Merit Award are awarded to all students entering
Taylor during the 2019-2020 academic year who meet the specified criteria. A student can only receive one academic scholarship from Taylor. Scholarships are
renewable each year with a minimum 2.95 GPA at Taylor. Scholarships are awarded for a maximum of 8 semesters.
Academic Merit Awards are given to all National Merit Finalists. The amount is $15,000. The Academic Merit Award is given in place of other Taylor
academic scholarships.
Students qualifying for a President, Dean, Faculty, or Trustee Scholarship are determined based upon each student’s high school grade point average (GPA) and
either the ACT (English, Math, Reading, Science) average score or SAT (Reading and Math) combined score. Test scores are super scored, meaning the highest
subset scores are added together from multiple test dates to determine a student’s academic scholarship. In order to be eligible for one of these scholarships, a
student must have a minimum high school GPA of 2.80 and either a minimum ACT (English, Math, Reading, Science) average score of 18 or SAT (Reading and
Math) combined score of 980. Eligible students can estimate their award by using the charts below. Students may add together scholarship points awarded for
high school GPA and scholarship points awarded for either ACT or SAT scores to estimate their scholarship.

Class Merit Awards are given to the top students, by GPA, in each of the sophomore, junior, and senior classes who are not already receiving an academic
scholarship from Taylor. Awards range from $4,000 to $8,000.
Need-Based Awards
The FAFSA determines need-based awards, which include need-based grants, loans, and work-study eligibility. The total aid package may not exceed the
student’s financial need as determined by the FAFSA.

 The only criterion for the Taylor Fund Grant is financial need. The amount will vary from year to year based on financial need as determined by the
FAFSA.
 The maximum amount for the Taylor University Loan is $1,500 per year according to financial need; repayment with a 7 percent interest rate begins
six months after the student leaves school. This long-term, low-interest loan program is designed to assist students who demonstrate financial need
as determined by the FAFSA. Repayment and interest on this loan begin after a student ceases to be enrolled on at least a half-time basis.
 To qualify for student employment, a student generally must demonstrate financial need. Exceptions include personnel assistants in residence halls or
students who possess required skills, such as computer knowledge.
Other Available Awards
Students may be eligible for other types of awards besides the merit-based and need-based scholarships:
 The Community Scholarship, for $3,000, is awarded yearly to select incoming freshmen. Accepted students who have interviewed and completed an
application for admission by December 1 are considered. Interested students must complete a scholarship application by January 1 and return to
campus for additional scholarship interviews. This scholarship is awarded for a maximum of eight semesters provided the student is enrolled full-time,
lives in university-owned housing, and maintains good academic and citizenship standing.
 The Church Matching Grant enables Taylor University to match 100 percent of a church’s gift to a student, with Taylor’s maximum match totaling
$2,000. A pledge form must be received by or submitted online to the Financial Aid Office by April 15, and the church gift must be received by July 1.

Health Services
Marion General Hospital Physicians and Nurse Practitioners provide healthcare services, including some pharmacy and lab services exclusively for Taylor
University students. The Taylor Student Health Center is located at 1809 S Main Street, across the street from campus. Students may use the Marion
General Hospital emergency department for emergency care and urgent problems. Marion General will bill the student’s insurance for after hour visits.
Students may also use other healthcare providers if they choose.
A full-time student pays a health service fee each fall and spring semester and January interterm. This fee may be waived only if the student is married, a
commuter from his or her parent’s home, or studying away from campus. In order for this fee to be removed from the bill of an eligible student, a waiver
must be obtained from the Bursar’s Office and signed by the end of the second week of classes each semester. Health services are not available during
summer sessions.
If a student has an illness that results in missed class and is treated by Health Services, he or she should obtain verification of the treatment by TU Health
Services and provide this as documentation along with a request for an excused absence. For details, refer to the Class Attendance section of this catalog.
Health Services will only provide documentation as to the treatment administered.
Housing Information
Taylor University is a residential campus by design; therefore, each single undergraduate student must live in university-owned housing or with his or her
parent or legal guardian in their home and commute from a distance of no greater than 50 miles. Students who have been admitted to Taylor University
and have paid the $200 matriculation deposit will receive a residence hall application from the Admissions Office. This material is to be completed and
returned to the Admissions Office before housing assignments will be made. $50 of the $200 matriculation deposit serves as a housing deposit and is
returned when the student leaves Taylor or cancels his or her acceptance; for additional details, refer to the Finance section of this catalog. Charges for
damage to residence hall property and other university-administered facilities are deducted from this housing deposit.
In order to accommodate the entire student body, it is sometimes necessary to supplement campus residential facilities. Off-campus housing is considered
overflow housing and is limited to the number of upperclassmen who cannot be accommodated in the residence halls. The number of students approved
to live off campus is dependent on projected enrollment and retention. Because these figures change from year to year, an application and approval process
has been established. Upperclassmen who have met the eligibility requirements are given the opportunity to apply (in February of a given year) to live off
campus the following year. Students living off campus are expected to abide by both the biblical and Taylor University responsibilities outlined in the Life
Together Covenant.
Married students and students over the age of 25 are automatically approved to live off campus. They must arrange to do so through the Center for Student
Development but may select housing that meets their particular needs.
Intercultural Programs
The Office of Intercultural Programs (OIP) seeks to serve the needs of American minoritized students, International, Third Culture and Missionary kids at Taylor
University. Act Six, An urban leadership scholarship, is also housed in OIP. The OIP works to foster an intercultural and Christ centered community by creating
a welcoming environment that provides l and leadership opportunities for students, staff. We also seek to enrich the experience of the broader Taylor’s
community by promoting racial and cultural awareness and sensitivity to issues related to diversity. We are committed to providing an environment where:
 We recognize the individual and corporate needs of international students, American minoritized students, and Third Culture and Missionary kids
 OIP forms Christ-centered and biblically anchored servant leaders
 Students are assured support, as well as advocacy relative to their unique concerns
 OIP student groups supply support and are empowered through leadership opportunities
 Positive, respectful, and meaningful dialogue regarding issues of race, culture and identity are encouraged
 The recruitment, retention, and graduation of international, American minoritized, and Missionary or Third Culture students is supported
 Students are being prepared for the future by engaging with a diverse community
As an office we house these student organizations:
 Asian Society for Intercultural Awareness (ASIA)
 Black Student Union (BSU)
 International Student Society (ISS)
 Latino Student Union (LSU)
 Middle Eastern Collegiate Association (MECA)
 Mu Kappa
 Multi-Ethnic Student Association (MESA)

222
Intramural Sports and Recreation Program
The Intramural Sports and Recreation Program, coordinated by the Taylor Student Organization, provides a wide variety of activities for meeting the
recreational and competitive needs of the entire Taylor student body. Team events include both a men’s and a women’s league for flag football, soccer,
dodge ball, ultimate Frisbee, and basketball; coed leagues exist for volleyball and softball. Many other individual tournaments, such as wiffle ball, tennis, 3 on
3 basketball, and 4 on 4 sand volleyball are held throughout the year.
Taylor’s Intramural Sports and Recreation Program has high participation rates. For example, flag football alone has more than 300 men and women
participants each year. Residence hall competition has been the driving force behind these high numbers. Intramural sports serve as another venue for our
community to holistically grow in worship of the Lord through fellowship, upright competition, and stewardship of the body, mind, and spirit.
Residence Life
Taylor University is a residential campus with a strong emphasis on community living. The purpose of the Residence Life program is to provide safe,
attractive, and comfortable physical facilities, structured educational programming, and an atmosphere conducive to unstructured learning experiences. In
addition, Residence Life seeks to create an environment that fosters the basic values of Christian community. The residence halls serve as living-learning
centers where students are challenged to grow and apply their faith through interaction with their neighbors. As living-learning centers, residence halls at
Taylor are designed to fulfill two goals: the first is to provide a community living experience through which students are exposed to a variety of educational
opportunities that transcend their chosen courses; second, they provide the resources and professional staff necessary to assist students in developing a
high degree of self-direction and responsible citizenship.
There are nine residence halls and two University apartments housing over 1,700 students. The halls have different room and floor configurations, affording
students the opportunity to choose a living environment that best suits them. Room assignments are made prior to the beginning of the fall term. Room
and roommate preferences are honored within the limits of available space. The University reserves the right to assign rooms when deemed appropriate.
Individual rooms are furnished with window coverings, beds, mattresses, desks, chairs, and dressers.
Each residence hall has a leadership team that includes personnel assistants, discipleship assistants, and representatives who serve on Student Senate. These
student leaders are supervised by residence hall directors who work as educators, counselors, and members of Taylor University faculty.
Student Clubs
Student clubs exist to provide a wide array of co-curricular experiences that meet social, academic, and practical needs of the Taylor University community.
Club interests range from academic (e.g., Psychology, Social Work, Environmental Science, Art, German, and Pre-Med) to activity-oriented (e.g., Equestrian,
Rugby). Students who have special interests not represented on campus are encouraged to seek club status through the Student Senate approval process.
Student Programs
The Office of Student Programs at Taylor University provides dynamic student leadership experiences that cultivate faith, passion, and calling and service
through relationships, learning, and excellent programs. The philosophy of our office is founded in the desire to develop thoughtful, Christ-centered leaders.
Programs encourage whole-person student learning and are marked by educational out-of-the-class experiences that connect with and complement in-class

Compliance
Taylor University complies with applicable federal and state statutes related to institutions of higher education, including the Student Right to Know Act of
1990, as amended; Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008; the Family Educational Rights and Privacy
Act of 1974, as amended; the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, as amended; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; and all federal and state
nondiscrimination laws.
Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA)
The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights include:
1. The right to inspect and review the student’s education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for
access. Students should submit to the Registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, written requests that identify
the record(s) they wish to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the
records may be inspected. If the University official to whom the request was submitted does not maintain the records, that official shall advise the
student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. At the post-secondary level, the right to inspect is limited solely to the
student. Records may be released to parents only under one of the following circumstances: 1) through the written consent of the student; 2) in
compliance with a subpoena; or 3) by submission of evidence that the parents declare the student as a dependent on their most recent Federal
Income Tax form.
2. The right to request the amendment of the student’s education records that the student believes are inaccurate or misleading.
Students may ask the University to amend a record that they believe is inaccurate or misleading. They should write to the University official
responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University
decides not to amend the record as requested by the student, the University will notify the student of the decision and advise the student of his or
her right to a hearing regarding the request for amendment. Additional information regarding the hearing procedures will be provided to the student
when notified of the right to a hearing.
3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s education records, except to
the extent that FERPA authorizes disclosure without consent. One exception which permits disclosure without consent is disclosure to
school officials with legitimate educational interests. A school official is a person employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory,
academic, or research or support staff position (including law enforcement unit personnel and health staff); a person or company with whom the
University has contracted (such as an attorney, auditor, or collection agent); a person serving on the Board of Trustees; or a student serving on an
official committee, such as a disciplinary or grievance committee, or assisting another school official in performing his or her tasks. A school official
has a legitimate educational interest if the official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility. Upon
request, the University may disclose education records without consent to officials of another school in which a student seeks or intends to enroll.
4. The right to file a complaint with the U.S. Department of Education concerning alleged failures by Taylor University to comply
with the requirements of FERPA. The name and address of the office that administers FERPA is: Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S.
Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue, SW, Washington, D.C. 20202-4605.
Intellectual Property Policy
The Taylor University Intellectual Property Policy designates that students retain copyright to most creative work for which they are solely responsible.
Exceptions can include work done while employed by the University or under other extenuating circumstances. Although students retain intellectual
property rights to most creative work submitted for academic credit, matriculation in the University entails an obligation for students to allow their writing
or similar creative work to be used for University academic assessment. Procedures will be followed to preserve the anonymity of students for such
assessment. The content and analysis of student writing or similar creative work selected for assessment will be used primarily for internal review of
academic programs. Observations and derivative findings from such analysis may be reported to accreditation agencies or disseminated through professional
publication but without reference to the authorship of individual students.
Notice of Non-discrimination
Taylor University does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, national origin, sex, disability, or age in its programs and activities. The following persons
have been designated to handle inquiries regarding the non-discrimination policies:
Chief Notification Officer:
Jesse Brown, Dean of Students and Title IX Coordinator
236 West Reade Avenue
Upland, IN 46989
(765) 998-5344
Deputy Notification Officer:
Rhoda Sommers, Dean of the School of Social Sciences, Business, and Education
236 West Reade Avenue
Upland, IN 46989
(765) 998-5108
231
Public Notice Designating Directory Information
Taylor University may release, without written consent, the following items which have been specified as public or directory information for current and
former students: name, address, email address, telephone listing, gender, photograph, field of study, grade level, enrollment status, date and place of birth,
dates of attendance, actual and anticipated graduation date, degree, honors and awards, previous educational agency or institution attended, participation in
officially recognized activities and sports, and weight and height of members of athletic teams.
A current student can request that the University not release any directory information about him or her. This designation must be furnished in writing to
the Registrar by the end of the first week of classes in the semester. Request to withhold prevents the disclosure of all directory information. Regardless
of the effect upon the student, the institution assumes no liability for honoring the student’s instructions that such information be withheld.
Publicity Release of Student Photograph
As a student at Taylor University, each student authorizes and irrevocably grants to Taylor University permission for his or her photograph or image to be
used in future University brochures, videos publications, newsletters, news releases, other printed materials and in materials made available on the Internet
or in other media now known or hereafter developed.
Services for Students with Disabilities
Taylor University complies with the federal mandates outlined in Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 and the Americans with Disabilities Act of
1990. Reasonable accommodations are made to give students with documentation of their disabilities an equal opportunity for success. These services are
provided through the Academic Enrichment Center located in the Zondervan Library.
Student Consumer Information
The Higher Education Act of 1965, as amended by the Higher Education Opportunity Act of 2008 (HEOA), requires institutions participating in federally
funded financial aid programs to make information about the institution available to current and prospective students. Taylor University has created a
webpage entitled Student Consumer Information to provide resources and information for parents, students, employees, and the Taylor community in
fulfillment of these mandates. This site will continue to be updated as we build more information that is useful and required.
Student Right to Know Act of 1990
The Student Right to Know Act of 1990 (Public Law 101-542 as amended) requires colleges and universities to maintain records of student enrollment,
graduation, and participation in athletically related financial aid. These data are available on the Taylor website and upon request from the Office of
Institutional Research, Taylor University, 236 West Reade Avenue, Upland, IN 46989, (765-998-4627).
